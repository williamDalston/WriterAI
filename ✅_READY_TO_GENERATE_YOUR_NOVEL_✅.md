**Setting:** Isolated Khevsurian mountain village, Georgian Caucasus, trapped November-March

**Protagonist:** Dr. Elene Javakhishvili - Georgian-American anthropologist, rational skeptic forced to confront the incomprehensible

**Antagonist:** Iona - Village elder, guardian of ancient ways (or prophet of cosmic horror?)
