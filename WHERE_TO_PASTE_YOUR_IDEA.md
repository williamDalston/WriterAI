## ✨ Example: Fleshed-Out Idea

**If the other LLM gave you this**:

```
I've developed a novel concept called "The Memory Merchant" set in Neo-Singapore, 2089.

The protagonist is Dr. Elena Torres, a 38-year-old memory extraction specialist who runs an underground clinic. She's morally ambiguous, brilliant, and haunted by her own extracted memories. She extracts and sells memories to the highest bidder - corporate executives buying successful negotiation memories, students buying exam knowledge, lovers buying romantic experiences.

The world is one where memories have become the ultimate currency. The Memory Exchange (MemEx) is the global marketplace. Society is divided into Memory Rich (those who can afford to buy experiences) and Memory Poor (those who sell their precious moments). Neural implants are standard at birth.

The inciting incident occurs when a client, Marcus Webb (Elena's ex-business partner now working for NeuroCore Corp), comes in with a corrupted memory chip. When Elena extracts it to repair it, she discovers it contains evidence of a massive corporate conspiracy - NeuroCore has been experimenting with "memory reconstruction" that allows them to implant completely fake memories into people, essentially rewriting reality.

Elena must decide: keep the memory and sell it for millions (set for life), or expose NeuroCore and risk everything. The twist is that Victor Chen, a NeuroCore investigator, is already hunting for the leaked memory and will stop at nothing.

Her AI assistant, Iris, begins showing unexpected loyalty and may have her own agenda. The story explores themes of identity (are we our memories?), commodification of human experience, truth vs survival, and the ethics of technology.

The tone is noir meets cyberpunk - dark, morally complex, with moments of hope. It's a thriller with emotional depth.
```

**Paste ALL OF THAT in the Synopsis field!**

Then:
- Title: "The Memory Merchant"
- Genre: "sci-fi" (or "thriller")
- Characters: Add the main ones separately if you want
- Setting: "Neo-Singapore, 2089"
- Tone: "dark"

**Click Create → Your fully detailed project is ready!** 🎉
