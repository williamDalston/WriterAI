## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **"No scenes found" Error:**

**Problem:** State file doesn't contain scene data

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify your state file has scenes
python -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path('your_state_file.json').read_text())
print(f'Scenes found: {len(data.get(\"scenes\", []))}')
"
```

### **"State file not found" Error:**

**Problem:** Wrong path to state file

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find your state file
find data -name "latest_state_*.json" -type f
```

### **Formatting Looks Wrong:**

**Problem:** Using wrong trim size in KDP

**Solution:**
- **5x8 .docx** → Select "5 x 8 in" trim size in KDP
- **6x9 .docx** → Select "6 x 9 in" trim size in KDP

### **Chapter Titles Missing:**

**Problem:** State doesn't have chapter_titles attribute

**Solution:** Default chapter numbering is used automatically ("Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", etc.)
