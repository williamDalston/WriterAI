## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results

1. **Always specify title and author:**
   ```bash
   --title "Your Novel Title" --author "Your Name"
   ```

2. **Preview before uploading:**
   Open the .docx file in Word/Google Docs to verify formatting

3. **Keep the markdown version:**
   The .md file is great for editing and version control

4. **Test with a short novel first:**
   If this is your first time, test with a smaller work

### Customization Options

**Longer chapters (5 scenes per chapter):**
```bash
--scenes-per-chapter 5
```

**Different output location:**
```bash
--output my_custom_path/novel.docx
```

**Exclude table of contents:**
```bash
--no-toc
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No scenes found"
**Solution:** Your novel generation isn't complete. Finish the pipeline first.

### Issue: "Module not found: docx"
**Solution:** Install python-docx: `pip install python-docx`

### Issue: "State file not found"
**Solution:** Find your state file: `ls data/*/state_snapshots/latest_state_*.json`

### Issue: Generic chapter titles (Chapter 1, Chapter 2...)
**Solution:** This is normal if thematic titles weren't generated. Generic titles are perfectly acceptable for publishing.
