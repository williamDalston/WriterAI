  --show-summary

# Step 2: Generate complete novel (60-90 minutes)
python cli.py generate --prompt "Same story idea"

# Step 3: Generate visualizations (2 minutes)
python cli.py visualize --type scene_map --state-file output/novel_state.json
python cli.py visualize --type emotional_heatmap --state-file output/novel_state.json
python cli.py visualize --type character_diagram --state-file output/novel_state.json
