## 🎯 Strategic Distribution

### Smart Work Distribution

**Use Worker Agents to Build Runtime Agents:**

```
Week 1:
  Worker Agent A → Generates WorldAgent (#4) code
  Worker Agent B → Generates tests
  Worker Agent C → Generates documentation
  Worker Agent H → Integrates with system
  Result: WorldAgent (#4) complete

Repeat for all 18 remaining Runtime Agents
```

**Parallel Work Streams:**

```
Day 1-2: WorldAgent (#4) + CharacterAgent (#6) (parallel)
Day 3-4: DraftingAgent (#7) + DialogueAgent (#8) + ProseAgent (#9) (parallel)
Day 5: ActionAgent (#10) + DescriptionAgent (#11) + SynthesisAgent (#12) (parallel)
```

**Leverage Existing Code:**

```
WorldAgent (#4) → Use stage_02_world_modeling.py logic
CharacterAgent (#6) → Use stage_04_character_profiles.py logic
DraftingAgent (#7) → Use stage_06_scene_drafting.py logic
QualityJudgeAgent (#13) → Use prometheus_lib.critics.scene_judge
```
