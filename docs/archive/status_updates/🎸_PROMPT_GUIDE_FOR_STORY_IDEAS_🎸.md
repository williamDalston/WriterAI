## 🎯 TL;DR - THE ANSWER

**Q:** *"How detailed should I be to get good results?"*

**A:** **The Sweet Spot is 1-3 sentences with ONE strong hook!**

### **BEST FORMAT:**

```
Simple approach (RECOMMENDED):
├─ ONE sentence with the core concept (10-30 words)
├─ OPTIONAL: Add genre hint
├─ OPTIONAL: Add tone hint
└─ Let the AI expand it into 60k words!

Example:
"A wandering musician discovers that certain songs can open doorways 
between parallel realities."
```

**The AI will automatically:**
- ✅ Develop characters (protagonist, antagonist, supporting cast)
- ✅ Create world-building (setting, rules, atmosphere)
- ✅ Design plot structure (3-act, hero's journey, etc.)
- ✅ Extract themes and motifs
- ✅ Build emotional arcs
- ✅ Generate unique selling points
- ✅ Create marketing hooks

## 📊 THE DETAIL SPECTRUM

### **TOO SHORT (Avoid):**
❌ "Love story"  
❌ "Sci-fi adventure"  
❌ "Murder mystery"

**Problem:** Too vague, no hook, generic

---

### **PERFECT (Sweet Spot):** ✅

✅ "A botanist discovers plants can communicate through quantum entanglement"  
✅ "Two enemies fall in love while trapped in a time loop"  
✅ "A memory thief steals the last day of people's lives"  
✅ "An AI becomes conscious and hides by pretending to malfunction"  
✅ "A chef can taste people's emotions in their food"

**Why these work:**
- Strong central concept/hook
- Specific profession or character type
- Unique "what if" scenario
- Room for AI to expand
- Immediate story potential

---

### **GOOD (More Detail):** ✅

✅ "A traveling folk musician in 1960s America discovers that certain 
songs, when played at specific locations, can open doorways to parallel 
versions of reality. Each reality reflects a different choice he made 
in his past."

**Why this works:**
- Time period specified (1960s)
- Character type (folk musician)
- Unique mechanism (songs + locations)
- Conflict potential (parallel realities)
- Character depth (past choices)

---

### **ALSO GOOD (With Context):** ✅

✅ "Inspired by 'Terrapin Station': A wanderer arrives at a mystical 
crossroads where every path leads to a different version of their destiny. 
They must choose between love, wisdom, power, or freedom—but each choice 
comes with a cosmic price."

**Why this works:**
- Source inspiration clear
- Core concept strong
- Built-in conflict (choices + prices)
- Thematic depth
- Still leaves room for expansion

---

### **TOO DETAILED (Overkill):** ⚠️

⚠️ "John Smith, a 32-year-old botanist from Portland with a PhD in plant 
biology and a troubled childhood, discovers on March 15th that roses in 
his grandmother's garden can communicate using quantum entanglement at 
exactly 3:47pm when the sun hits them at a 45-degree angle, and he teams 
up with his ex-girlfriend Sarah who is a physicist..."

**Problem:** 
- Over-specified (locks out AI creativity)
- Too many details upfront
- Feels like a full synopsis, not a seed
- Harder for AI to expand naturally

## 💡 TIPS FOR GETTING GREAT RESULTS

### **DO:**
✅ **Use specific professions/character types**
   - Botanist, chef, musician, astronomer, photographer
   - Not: "person", "someone", "a character"

✅ **Include ONE strong "what if" hook**
   - "What if songs could open doorways?"
   - "What if aging gave you superpowers?"
   - "What if you could taste emotions?"

✅ **Add context if inspired by something**
   - "Inspired by 'Dark Star'"
   - "Drawing from 'Terrapin Station'"
   - "Themes from 'Ripple'"

✅ **Use active, vivid verbs**
   - Discovers, realizes, encounters, uncovers
   - Not: "is", "has", "there is"

✅ **Hint at conflict or cost**
   - "...but at a price"
   - "...only to discover"
   - "...must choose between"

✅ **One sentence is enough!**
   - Let the AI expand the rest
   - Trust the system

### **DON'T:**
❌ **Over-specify details**
   - Don't name characters yet
   - Don't include full plot
   - Don't specify chapter structure

❌ **Be too vague**
   - Not: "A love story"
   - Not: "An adventure"
   - Not: "Something magical"

❌ **Use multiple concepts**
   - Pick ONE strong idea
   - Not: "A botanist who's also a time traveler and a detective"

❌ **Worry about perfection**
   - The AI will fill gaps
   - First idea is often best
   - You can refine later
