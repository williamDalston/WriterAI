## 🚀 HOW TO GENERATE ALL 50 SCENES

The issue is that the beat sheet only has 5 beats. We need 50 scenes. Here are the options:

### Option 1: Regenerate from Scratch with 50-Beat Target ⭐ RECOMMENDED

Start fresh from Stage 1, telling the LLM to create a 50-beat structure:

**Time**: 5-6 hours  
**Cost**: ~$5-10  
**Result**: Complete 100,000-word novel

```bash
# I'll need to:
1. Update beat sheet prompt to request 50 beats instead of 15
2. Regenerate from Stage 1 with target_scenes: 50
3. Run all stages 1-12 on all 50 scenes
4. Export with proper naming
```

### Option 2: Expand Current 5 Beats into 50 Scenes

Keep the existing 5-beat structure but expand each beat into 10 scenes:

**Time**: 4-5 hours  
**Cost**: ~$4-8  
**Result**: 50 scenes based on existing 5-part structure

```bash
# For each of the 5 beats:
Beat 1 → Scenes 1-10  (Arrival & Discovery)
Beat 2 → Scenes 11-20 (Growing Unease)
Beat 3 → Scenes 21-30 (Ritual Revealed)
Beat 4 → Scenes 31-40 (Descent into Belief)
Beat 5 → Scenes 41-50 (The Mountain's Price)
```

### Option 3: Continue with Current Pipeline (Testing Only)

Keep the 1-scene version for testing, verify all stages work, then do full generation later.

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start the full 50-scene generation NOW** so it runs overnight!

I'll:
1. ✅ Update the beat sheet prompt to create a 50-scene structure
2. ✅ Regenerate from Stage 3 (beat sheet)
3. ✅ Run all scenes through stages 4-12 (all working!)
4. ✅ Export with proper naming: `The_Last_Verse_of_the_Mountain_50_Scenes_18_Chapters.docx`
