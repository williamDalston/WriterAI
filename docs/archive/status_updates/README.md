# Status Updates Archive

This directory contains historical status update files from the development process. These files document progress, milestones, and status reports during the WriterAI project development.

## What's Here

These files are **archived status updates** that were created during active development to track progress. They include:

- ⏳ Generation status updates
- ✅ Completion confirmations
- ⚠️ Issue reports and fixes
- 🎉 Success announcements
- 📊 Progress reports
- 🚀 Launch and deployment updates
- ⭐ System status updates

## Why Archived?

These files were moved here to:
1. **Clean up the root directory** - Keep only active documentation visible
2. **Preserve history** - Maintain a record of development progress
3. **Improve navigation** - Make it easier to find current documentation

## Current Documentation

For current, active documentation, see:
- **[DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md)** - Main documentation index
- **[README.md](../../../README.md)** - Project overview
- **[QUICKSTART.md](../../../QUICKSTART.md)** - Quick start guide

## File Organization

Files are organized by their original creation date and purpose. They remain in the repository for historical reference but are not part of the active documentation set.
