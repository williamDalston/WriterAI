## 🎯 What You Can Do NOW

### 1. Create Projects Easily

**Before**:
- Manual YAML editing
- 15-30 minutes setup
- Error-prone

**NOW**:
- Paste your idea
- 30 seconds setup
- Auto-configured!

```bash
python -m interfaces.cli.main new --interactive
```

### 2. Use Unified Commands

```bash
# All operations through one CLI
python -m interfaces.cli.main new        # Create project
python -m interfaces.cli.main generate   # Generate novel
python -m interfaces.cli.main compile    # Compile result
python -m interfaces.cli.main list       # List projects
python -m interfaces.cli.main status     # Check status
```

### 3. Navigate Clean Codebase

```
prometheus_novel/
├── interfaces/     # 🆕 Organized interfaces
├── tests/          # 🆕 All tests here
├── legacy/         # 🗂️ Old files (57 archived)
├── docs/           # 📚 Clear documentation
└── [8 core files]  # ✨ Clean root
```

### 4. Use Development Tools

```bash
make test           # Run all tests
make lint           # Check code quality
make format         # Format code
make new-project    # Create project
make help           # See all commands
```

## 🚀 Recommended Next Actions

### This Week: Use the System

1. **Create a test project**
   ```bash
   python -m interfaces.cli.main new --interactive
   ```

2. **Try the example**
   ```bash
   python -m interfaces.cli.main new --from-file examples/quick-start-example.txt
   ```

3. **Generate a short outline** (stages 1-5 only, fast):
   ```bash
   python -m interfaces.cli.main generate \
     --config configs/your_project.yaml \
     --end-stage 5
   ```

4. **Explore the documentation**
   - Read `START_HERE.md`
   - Browse `USAGE_GUIDE.md`

5. **Try development commands**
   ```bash
   make test
   make help
   ```

### Next Session: Phase 2 (Optional)

When you're ready for more improvements:

**Phase 2 Goals** (2-3 hours):
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Increase test coverage (15% → 50%+)
3. Add type hints where missing
4. Improve error handling

**Phase 3 Goals** (2-3 hours):
1. Convert ideas.txt to SQLite database
2. Add monitoring and metrics
3. Performance optimization

**Phase 4 Goals** (2-3 hours):
1. Docker containerization
2. Deployment automation
3. Security hardening

**But you don't need Phase 2-4 to use the system!** Everything works now.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Interactive Mode

The interactive mode is the easiest way to create projects:
```bash
python -m interfaces.cli.main new --interactive
```

### 2. Use Genre Templates

The system has 10 pre-configured genres:
- sci-fi, fantasy, mystery, thriller, romance
- horror, literary, historical, dystopian, adventure

Just specify the genre and get optimized settings!

### 3. Generate Outlines First

Before generating full prose (slow), generate just the outline:
```bash
# Stages 1-5: outline only (fast, ~10 minutes)
python -m interfaces.cli.main generate --config configs/project.yaml --end-stage 5

# Review the outline, then continue:
python -m interfaces.cli.main generate --config configs/project.yaml --start-stage 6
```

### 4. Use Make Commands

The Makefile has 30+ convenient commands:
```bash
make help           # See everything
make test           # Run tests
make new-project    # Interactive creation
```

### 5. Check the Examples

Use the provided example as a template:
```bash
cat examples/quick-start-example.txt
```

## 🎨 Ideas for Your First Projects

### Sci-Fi Example
```
Title: The Last Upload
Genre: Sci-Fi
Synopsis: In 2099, consciousness uploading is finally possible, but immortality comes with a price—digital beings can be deleted. A detective must solve a murder in cyberspace where the victim might still be alive.
```

### Mystery Example
```
Title: The Clockwork Alibi
Genre: Mystery
Synopsis: Every witness has the perfect alibi, backed by GPS data, security cameras, and timestamped photos. But someone is lying, and Detective Sarah Park must figure out how the impossible murder happened.
```

### Fantasy Example
```
Title: The Unmemory
Genre: Fantasy
Synopsis: In a world where memories can be stolen and sold, a young thief discovers she's been collecting not random memories, but pieces of a spell that could unmake reality itself.
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Old Files Still Exist

The 57 duplicate files are in `legacy/` for reference. You can:

**Keep them**: They're documented and organized
```bash
# They're in prometheus_novel/legacy/
```

**Delete them**: System works without them
```bash
cd prometheus_novel
rm -rf legacy/  # Only if you're sure!
```

**Recommended**: Keep them for now, delete later when confident.

### Migration from Old System

If you have old scripts or workflows:
- See `docs/MIGRATION.md` for complete migration guide
- See `legacy/README.md` for file-by-file replacement
- Most features are in the new CLI

### No Breaking Changes to Core

The core pipeline, API, and compilation still work the same way. Only the duplicate helper scripts were moved.

## 🆘 If Something Breaks

### CLI Not Working?
```bash
cd prometheus_novel
python -m interfaces.cli.main --help
```

### Import Errors?
```bash
make install
# or
poetry install
```

### Tests Failing?
```bash
make test
# Check logs/prometheus_novel.log
```

### Can't Find a Feature?
- Check `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- Check `docs/MIGRATION.md`
- Check `legacy/README.md`
