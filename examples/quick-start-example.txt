Title: The Lighthouse Keeper's Secret

Genre: Mystery

Synopsis:
When renowned marine biologist Dr. Sarah Chen accepts a position as the keeper of 
Blackrock Lighthouse, she expects solitude and time for research. Instead, she 
discovers the journal of the previous keeper, Thomas Brennan, who vanished three 
months ago. His final entries describe strange lights beneath the waves, underwater 
ruins that shouldn't exist, and cryptic warnings about "the visitors." 

As Sarah investigates, she finds that every lighthouse keeper for the past century 
has kept similar journals, and none have left the island voluntarily. The deeper 
she digs into the lighthouse's history, the more she realizes the ocean is hiding 
something ancientâ€”and it's been watching the lighthouse keepers all along.
