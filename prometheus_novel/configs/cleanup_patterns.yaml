# Configurable cleanup patterns for scene content
# Built-ins always present; YAML adds more.
# Use disabled_builtins to suppress specific built-in patterns per project.

  - "rest of the chapter remains unchanged"
  - "everything after this remains unchanged"

inline_preamble_markers:

# Suppress specific built-in patterns that cause false positives for your project.
# Preferred: use exact pattern_name (see list below). Legacy substring matching also works.
#
# Available pattern names:
#   rest_unchanged, rest_unchanged_bracket, current_scene_header, visible_pct_marker,
#   enhanced_scene_header, heres_revised, hook_instruction_bleed, writing_tips_bullets,
#   scene_header_chapter, scene_header_pov, scene_header_count,
#   xml_tag_scene, xml_tag_chapter, xml_tag_content,
#   beat_sheet_physical, beat_sheet_emotional, beat_sheet_sensory
#
# Example:
#   disabled_builtins:
#     - "beat_sheet_physical"     # Our prose legitimately uses "Physical beats:"
#     - "hook_instruction_bleed"  # False positive in dialogue
