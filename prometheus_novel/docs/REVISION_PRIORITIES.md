# Revision Priorities: the-bends (and Future Projects)

Ranked by impact vs effort. Tackle in order unless a specific deadline dictates otherwise.

---

## Tier 1: Structural (Do First)

| # | Issue | Why first | Effort |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Ch 9→10 bridge** | Readers hit a hard stop; narrative logic collapses | Done (bridge added) |
| 2 | **Sato double never resolved** | Single most dramatic event, then vanishes. Decide: cut it or explain it | Medium: 1–2 scenes to either resolve or replace |
| 3 | **Missing scene / timeline stitches** | Scene transitions don't signal location/time; compression feels arbitrary | Medium: Add 1–2 transitional sentences per major break |
| 4 | **Elena's role creep** | PR fixer → life support admin → command decisions. Establish why she has access/codes | Low: Add 1–2 lines of setup early (briefing, delegation, prior role) |

---

## Tier 2: Character + Voice

| # | Issue | Why second | Effort |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 5 | **Voice bleed** | Everyone sounds the same; dialogue interchangeable | Medium: Pass each character's lines with distinct vocabulary, rhythm, avoidance patterns |
| 6 | **Character roster consistency** | Marcus appears once; Linnea comes and goes; crew size fluctuates | Medium: Lock cast list, add brief re-entry beats when someone returns |
| 7 | **Name consistency (Aris/Kade/Dr. Kade)** | Pick one form, apply everywhere | Low: Find-replace pass |
| 8 | **Aris motivation** | Shifts every scene. Lock: one coherent motive (e.g. "expose Silas's project" + "punish Elena") | Low–Medium: One pass to align his dialogue and actions |

---

## Tier 3: Craft + Repetition

| # | Issue | Why third | Effort |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 9 | **Physical tic overuse** | Sleeve adjust 7+ times; jaw, breath, temple. Diversify or cut | Low: Search for tics, keep 1–2 per character per chapter |
| 10 | **Thriller widget repetition** | Timers, blackouts, corrupted logs, sealed doors—each good once | Low: Audit list, trim redundant uses |
| 11 | **Sensory palette** | Metallic air, amber lights, water beads. Add vibration, sound texture, touch | Low: Sprinkle 2–3 new registers in key scenes |
| 12 | **Theme on-the-nose** | "Narrative," "performance," "authenticity" said too often | Low: Replace half with action/detail that demonstrates |

---

## Tier 4: World + Stakes

| # | Issue | Why fourth | Effort |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 13 | **Setting contradictions** | Dock vs helicopter; velvet lounge vs industrial; carpet vs metal | Medium: Create one physical map, align all references |
| 14 | **Plausibility drift** | CO₂, airlock breach, medical cause—inconsistent consequences | Medium: One pass for cause-effect consistency |
| 15 | **MOTHER AI dropped** | Introduced, then never mentioned | Low: Either cut early mention or add 1–2 callbacks |
| 16 | **Ending specificity** | What happened? Who was responsible? What was the project? | High: May require structural rework of final 1–2 chapters |

---

## Pipeline vs Manual

| Pipeline (future runs) | Manual (this draft) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Design guardrails block clone/double | Sato double: cut or resolve |
| POV slip detection, repair | Voice bleed, Aris motive |
| Physical tic, tense leak, echoing detection | Already running; use for next draft |
| Phantom character check | Marcus, Linnea entrances |
| — | Revision checklist (REVISION_CHECKLIST.md) |

## Suggested Order for the-bends

1. **Week 1:** Tier 1 (bridge done; Sato double, transitions, Elena role)
2. **Week 2:** Tier 2 items 5–8 (voice, roster, names, Aris)
3. **Week 3:** Tier 3 (tics, widgets, sensory, theme)
4. **Week 4:** Tier 4 (setting map, plausibility, MOTHER, ending)

### One-Line Reminder

> **Fewer jump cuts, fewer repeated widgets, stricter reality rulebook.** Chaos feels earned when the world and cast obey their own rules.
