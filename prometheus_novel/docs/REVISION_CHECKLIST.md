# 10-Point Revision Checklist

Run this pass on each chapter before considering a draft complete. Catches the "quiet killers" that erode reader trust.

---

## 1. **Character + Relationship Clarity**
- [ ] No more than 3–4 named characters in the first chapter; introduce others gradually
- [ ] Name consistency: Pick one form (e.g. "Dr. Aris Kade" vs "Kade" vs "Dr. Kade") and stick to it
- [ ] Relationship stakes are **stated**, not only implied: What is X to Y? (manager? ex? handler?)
- [ ] If a character can do something pivotal ("reset Jax's narrative"), the story explains **why them**

---

## 2. **Scene Transitions + Timeline**
- [ ] Every scene break signals location/time change (e.g. "Two hours later, in the Velvet Lounge…")
- [ ] No arbitrary compression: If "two hours passed since evacuation," earlier beats must support that
- [ ] Each confrontation/tension beat is resolved or advanced before the next one starts
- [ ] No "restart tension without resolving prior beat" (avoids loop feeling)

---

## 3. **Internal vs External Balance**
- [ ] Enough concrete situational facts: Where are they? What's the mission? What are the rules?
- [ ] Not over-relying on internal posture (counting breaths, sleeves, jaw) without advancing plot
- [ ] Readers need **facts** to anchor mystery; confusion ≠ mystery

---

## 4. **Motivations**
- [ ] Antagonists have **specific goals**, not just "ominous" or "predatory"
- [ ] If everyone is "playing chess," the reader sees the board (stakes, alliances, constraints)
- [ ] "Someone sabotaged it" used sparingly; when used, the *who* and *why* are eventually clear

---

## 5. **Tone + Meta Devices**
- [ ] Meta interruptions ("No. Wait. Rewind."): Either use once as artifact, or make them a deliberate device with clear rules
- [ ] No accidental draft artifacts that read like AI glitches

---

## 6. **Thriller Widget Repetition**
Check that each appears at most 1–2 times per novel:
- [ ] Timers / countdowns
- [ ] Blackouts
- [ ] Corrupted logs
- [ ] Sealed doors
- [ ] "Someone's breathing in the doorway"
- [ ] "Message appears on screen"
- [ ] "Manual override engaged"

If overused, readers predict the mechanism instead of fearing the outcome.

---

## 7. **Stakes vs Plausibility**
- [ ] Medical/scientific cause is grounded (CO₂ → headache, confusion, dyspnea; show progression)
- [ ] "Outer airlock breach" has **immediate, consistent** consequences—not both catastrophic and manageable
- [ ] Bodies, trauma, fear: cause matches effect

---

## 8. **Theme vs On-the-Nose**
- [ ] Theme (e.g. narrative, authenticity, control) is **shown** through events
- [ ] Reduce direct repetition of theme words (narrative, performance, authenticity metrics, control slipping)
- [ ] Let events demonstrate; say it out loud less

---

## 9. **Sensory + Physical Variety**
- [ ] Not only metallic air, amber lights, water beads
- [ ] Add 2–3 other registers: vibration (hull resonance), sound texture (scrubber rhythm, pump cavitation), touch (pressure in ears, skin dryness, static shocks)
- [ ] Physical tics (sleeve adjust, jaw clench): max 1–2 per chapter, not every scene

---

## 10. **Conflict Pacing + Voice**
- [ ] Not every scene is a confrontation; space them so key face-offs stand out
- [ ] Character voices are distinct: Clip the dialogue tags and verify you can tell who’s speaking
- [ ] Each major character has a recognizable speech pattern, not one "tense conversation" register for all

---

### One-Line Diagnostic

> You have **a high-grade voice + premise** if the draft has **fewer jump cuts, fewer repeated thriller widgets, and a stricter reality rulebook** so the chaos feels earned instead of generated.
