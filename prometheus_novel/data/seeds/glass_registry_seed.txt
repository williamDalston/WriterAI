IDEA:
A woman who processes other people's memories for a government archive discovers the state has been quietly erasing her own — and the investigator sent to stop her is the only person who believes she's telling the truth.

TITLE:
The Glass Registry

GENRE:
Romantic Suspense (with light speculative edge)

TONE:
Tense, intimate, sensory, morally charged. Romantic tension is the primary engine.

TARGET_LENGTH:
novella (30k)

SETTING:
Marrow Bay, a salt-bitten coastal city where fog horns, ferry bells, and rusted shipyards live beside sleek civic towers. The city runs on "Memory Tax" policies: citizens must periodically submit certain memories for "archival compliance."

WORLD_RULES:
1) The Glass Registry is a government-run archive that can legally seize, store, and redact memories tied to "public risk."
2) Redactions leave "glare gaps": sensory blanks that people unconsciously try to fill with false certainty.
3) Illegal "mirror tech" can replay redacted memories, but only in fractured, unreliable shards.
4) Physical objects can trigger partial recall (salt, glass, music), but never the full truth at once.

KEY_LOCATIONS:
- The Glass Registry (white marble, cold light, constant hush)
- Aruq Lighthouse (abandoned, wind-screamed, rumored dead drop site)
- Marrow Bay Ferry Terminal (commuter crowds, diesel, gulls)
- The Salt Market (vendors, brine barrels, whispered side deals)
- Tideglass Rooftop Bar (rich people, surveillance, romantic pressure-cooker)
- The Shipbreaker Yards (sparks, shadows, hard confessions)

PROTAGONIST:
Lena Sato, late 20s, Registry intake specialist who secretly hates what the system does to people. Precise, stubborn, quietly brave. Her private wound: her brother disappeared after a "compliance audit," and everyone insists she's misremembering him.

ANTAGONIST:
Elias Rourke (LOVE INTEREST), early 30s, Registry field investigator. Controlled, principled, unnervingly observant. He believes order prevents catastrophe, until Lena forces him to confront what "order" costs. Their tension should feel like two blades held too close.

OTHER_CHARACTERS:
- Noor Amari: black-market "mirror tech" operator, charming, dangerous, oddly ethical
- Captain Ivo Reyes: ferry captain who remembers too much and says too little
- Director Maelin Voss: Registry executive who speaks in beautiful lies

PREMISE:
A woman who processes other people's memories realizes the state has been quietly erasing her own. She steals access to her sealed file to prove her missing brother existed. The investigator assigned to catch her becomes the only person who treats her memories as potentially true.

CENTRAL_CONFLICT:
Lena must retrieve proof of her brother's existence before the Registry permanently deletes the last trace, while Elias closes in, torn between duty and the growing certainty that the system is manufacturing "reality."

KEY_PLOT_POINTS:
- Inciting Incident: Lena sees a familiar phrase in a new intake file that only her brother used to say.
- First Act Turn: she breaks protocol and pulls her sealed archival key, triggering an internal alarm.
- Midpoint Twist: the mirror-tech shard shows Elias in one of her brother's redacted memories, but not as the villain she expected.
- Dark Night: Lena learns the Registry didn't just erase the brother, it edited her emotional history with him.
- Climax: confrontation at Aruq Lighthouse where the final shard can be played once, and only once, before it burns out.
- Resolution: Lena chooses a truth that costs her something real, not a neat win.

SUBPLOTS:
- Noor offers Lena a shortcut that feels like betrayal with good intentions.
- Elias has a personal stake: someone he loved was "protected" by redaction, and he's terrified of what he'll feel if it's undone.

THEMES:
Consent, identity, manufactured reality, the ethics of safety, love as recognition.

CENTRAL_QUESTION:
If your memories can be seized and edited, what does it mean to choose someone, or to be chosen?

MOTIFS:
Salt (truth that stings), Glass (clarity that cuts), Blackbird calls (warnings / omens), A ticking countdown clock (time running out on identity)

WRITING_STYLE:
Close first-person (Lena), present tense. Clean but lyrical. Sensory grounding (salt air, cold marble light, diesel, glass glare). Subtext-heavy dialogue.

INFLUENCES:
Romantic suspense pacing, intimate psychological realism, noir coastal atmosphere.

AVOID:
No meta commentary. No "Here is…". No lists in prose. No generic vague hooks. No filler phrases like "everything changes" or "nothing is as it seems."

STRATEGIC_GUIDANCE:
market_positioning:
- Enemies-to-lovers romantic suspense with a high-concept "memory tax" hook.
- Promise: sharp tension, moral ambiguity, sensory atmosphere, a romance that hurts before it heals.

tropes:
- Enemies-to-lovers
- Forced proximity (stakeout / shared hiding)
- "I can't trust you but I can't let you go"
- Third-act betrayal (rooted in protection, not cruelty)

pacing_notes:
- Every chapter ends with a small reveal or new pressure.
- Keep external stakes and emotional stakes braided together.

dialogue_bank:
- Lena: "Don't tell me what I remember."
- Elias: "I'm not here to punish you. I'm here to stop you."
- Noor: "Truth is expensive. You paying cash or blood?"

aesthetic_guide:
- Fog, glass, salt, cold light, rusted metal, distant horns, surveillance as ambience.
