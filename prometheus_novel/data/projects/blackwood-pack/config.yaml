# --- Characters (pipeline expects strings, not dicts) ---
protagonist: >
  Elena Vance, 26. The Survivor. Hyper-vigilant (counts exits), resourceful,
  touch-starved, secretly fierce, street-smart. Escaping an abusive ex-husband,
  hiding under the radar working as a waitress in Silver Springs. Wants safety
  and anonymity; needs to stop running and fight for a real home. Her fear:
  control disguised as protection. Her secret strength: when cornered, she
  becomes unstoppable. Female, dark hair, lean from running.

antagonist: >
  Marcus, leader of the Rogue Syndicate cell targeting fated mates to weaken
  Alphas and destabilize packs. Calculating, patient, treats pack destruction
  as a business operation. Uses scouts and informants rather than direct
  confrontation until the climax. The real threat is his intelligence, not
  his strength.

other_characters: >
  Kaelen Thorn (30, the Alpha love interest, tortured protector, monosyllabic,
  over-protective, self-sacrificing, violently possessive toward threats, ruthless
  competence under pressure. His human logic rejects Elena to protect her; his
  wolf is dying without her touch. Male, scarred hands, built like a logger).
  Jax (Beta, tension-breaker, loyal, flirt veneer hiding trauma, suspicious of
  a mole, Book 2 setup). Ronan (Enforcer, scarred, brutal, protective, Book 3
  setup). Sarah (Healer, bond mechanics exposition in small doses, caretaking
  scenes). Tamsin (waitress, human ally, helps Elena integrate, town texture).

# --- Story ---
premise: >
  When Elena Vance's car breaks down in a blizzard on Blackwood Mountain, she's
  rescued by the reclusive Alpha, Kaelen. He recognizes her as his Fated Mate
  instantly but brutally rejects her to keep her off the Rogue Syndicate's radar.
  Snowed in together, the bond becomes torture. As enemies close in, Kaelen must
  choose between strategy and instinct.

central_conflict: >
  Kaelen pushes Elena away to protect her; the mate bond and external threats
  force intimacy, trust, and eventual acceptance. His lie: love creates targets.
  Her fear: that his protection is just another cage.

synopsis: >
  Elena Vance didn't come to Blackwood Mountain for salvation. She came to
  disappear. A blizzard has other plans. When her car dies on the mountain road,
  the reclusive Alpha Kaelen Thorn drags her from the snow — and the moment her
  scent hits him, something in him snaps into place. Mate. Then he does the one
  thing no Alpha should ever do: he rejects her. Snowed in at his isolated cabin,
  Elena fights the pull she doesn't understand and the fear that the only man who
  makes her feel safe might be the monster she ran from. But when the Rogue
  Syndicate closes in, hunting fated mates to destabilize packs, Kaelen's control
  fractures. And once his wolf decides she's his, the mountain won't hide anyone
  who tries to take her.

key_plot_points: >
  ACT 1:
  - Opening: Elena stranded in blizzard, failing phone, panic rising.
  - Inciting incident: Kaelen finds her; scent hits; he saves her then rejects her verbally.
  - The Void begins immediately for both; physical consequences show on-page.
  - Forced proximity: Snowed in at Kaelen's cabin; he tries distance; bond escalates.
  ACT 2:
  - First external threat (by Ch3): Rogue scout appears; cabin perimeter tested.
  - Midpoint: Rogues attack the cabin; Kaelen injured defending Elena; caretaking scene.
  - Revelation: Elena realizes rejection was protection, not hatred.
  - Low point: Kaelen tries to send her away anyway; Elena refuses; bond near breaking point.
  ACT 3:
  - Climax: Elena taken by Rogues to the Old Mine Shafts.
  - Rescue: Kaelen embraces bond, goes feral to track her; mine showdown.
  - Resolution: Public claim/acceptance; Elena chooses pack life.
  - Hook: Evidence of mole + Jax finds a scent trail leading into Book 2.

subplots: >
  - The Mole: someone is leaking pack movement to the Rogues (teased, not resolved).
  - Elena's human past: the abusive ex is a looming fear (teased, not the main villain).

themes: >
  Fate cannot be fought. Strength in vulnerability. Home is a person, not a place.
  Protection vs possession — the line between guarding someone and caging them.

central_question: >
  Can Kaelen overcome his fear of loss and accept the bond as strength, not weakness?

motifs: >
  Snow and cold vs body heat. Amber eyes (wolf near the surface). The scent of
  pine and rain. Scars (physical and emotional). Fireplace light in a dark cabin.
  Doors and thresholds (choosing to stay or leave).

setting: >
  Blackwood Mountain, Colorado. A snow-heavy mining and logging town on the edge
  of wilderness. Silver Springs is neutral ground where humans live unaware and
  shifters pass as locals. The Blackwood Pack territory begins where the road
  turns to timber and the air smells like pine, diesel, and cold. Late winter,
  heavy snowfall, isolation.

key_locations: >
  Kaelen's isolated cabin (forced proximity, storm shelter, intimacy pressure-cooker).
  The Roadhouse bar (neutral ground, public tension, pack politics without long councils).
  The Pack compound (training yard, hierarchy, pack hospital).
  The Old Mine Shafts (climax environment, echoing tunnels, high danger).
  Pack hospital (healer exposition, caretaking scenes).
  Mechanic shop / logging yard (blue-collar texture, physical action while talking).
  Ridgeline lookout (scent on the wind, wolf instincts, bond awareness).

world_rules: >
  Wolf shifters in contemporary Colorado. Fated mates: scent triggers a biological
  imperative; separation causes escalating pain and instability. Rejection creates
  "The Void": physical deterioration and emotional destabilization in both mates
  unless the bond is accepted or ends in death. Shifters' eyes flare gold/amber
  when the wolf is near the surface; full gold during dominance/territory threats.
  Alpha command can compel via "The Voice" (rare, dangerous, emergency only).
  Shifting burns calories fast; injuries heal faster but require protein/rest.
  Mate-bite/marking seals the bond and amplifies tracking and emotional resonance.
  The Rogue Syndicate targets fated mates to weaken Alphas and destabilize packs.
  No magic beyond shifting. Technology is modern. Humans are unaware.

# --- Style ---
writing_style: >
  First person, dual POV, alternating chapters. Elena odd chapters (1,3,5,7,9,11),
  Kaelen even chapters (2,4,6,8,10,12). Each chapter opens with a POV header
  (ELENA or KAELEN). Short punchy sentences during action; sensory-heavy writing
  emphasizing smell, touch, and heat. Minimal exposition — show world through
  action. Kaelen's wolf voice appears in italics as a distinct, blunt inner
  presence ("Mine. Ours. Protect."). No head-hopping within a scene or chapter.

influences: >
  Rejected mate trope execution (Cate C. Wells energy). PNR heat level (Suzanne
  Wright vibe). Shifter atmosphere (Bitten-style grit). Blue-collar romance
  texture (Sarina Bowen small-town vibes).

avoid: >
  - Third-person narration or head-hopping within a scene
  - Long pack councils, political meetings, or talking-head scenes
  - Lore lectures or history dumps before Chapter 3
  - Polite, emotionally articulate Alpha in early chapters (monosyllabic until walls crack)
  - Weak/fainting heroine (Elena fights, runs, or strategizes — never passively waits)
  - Purple prose or flowery metaphors ("electricity coursed through" etc.)
  - Vague villains or off-page threats (Marcus and scouts must appear on-page)
  - Therapy-speak or modern emotional vocabulary from Kaelen
  - Generic "fate" language without grounding it in physical sensation
  - AI tells: "couldn't help but", "I found myself", "a whirlwind of emotions"

    injured, "Mine", Only one bed (cabin has one bedroom).

  pacing_notes: >
    Rejection by Chapter 1-2, no delays. Villain presence on-page (or minions) by
    Chapter 3. First major intimacy by ~40% mark. Bond reminders every chapter
    (scent/eyes/wolf reaction). Every scene has physical action, not just dialogue.
    No chapter without either external threat progression or bond escalation.

  dialogue_bank: >
    Elena: sharp, defensive humor used as armor. Short sentences when scared, longer
    when she's gaining confidence. Swears when cornered. Never pleads.
    Kaelen: monosyllabic early ("Go." "No." "Stay."). His wolf voice in italics is
    blunt and possessive ("Mine. Ours. Keep."). When walls crack, his sentences
    get longer and rawer. Never flowery — gravel-voiced sincerity.
    Jax: easy charm, deflects with jokes, uses nicknames, hides worry behind grins.

  aesthetic_guide: >
    Visual palette: snow white, pine green, firelight amber, blood red, midnight
    blue. Textures: rough bark, wool blankets, cold metal, warm skin, wet fur.
    Sounds: wind through pines, fire crackling, bones shifting, heartbeats, silence.
    Smells: pine, woodsmoke, rain, blood, the mate-scent (described differently by
    each POV character).

  cultural_notes: >
    Blue-collar mountain town authenticity: logging, mechanic work, practical
    clothing, pickup trucks, roadhouse bars. No glamorized wealth. Pack hierarchy
    shown through action and deference, not explained through lectures.
