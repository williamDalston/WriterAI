  views women as disposable pawns and wants to break the peace treaty to usurp Alexei.

  commercial_notes: 'Series Potential: ''The Volkov Brotherhood''. Introduce his two
    lieutenants (The Psycho and The Quiet One) for books 2 and 3. Mobile-first tip:
    End every chapter on a hook (a kiss, a threat, a revelation) to encourage scroll-through.'
  cultural_notes: 'Use correct hierarchy terms: Pakhan (Boss), Brigadier (Captain),
    Vor v Zakone (Thief in Law). The hero drinks vodka neat, no ice. He does not smile
    often; his affection is shown through protection and spending.'
