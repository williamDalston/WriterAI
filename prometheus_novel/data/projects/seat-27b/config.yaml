  Ana''s fear of falling for someone who might ask her to give up her life for his.
  The memory of one perfect conversation versus the mess of actually trying.

key_plot_points: "- ACT 1: The flight. They meet in seats 27B and 27A. Awkward start\n\
  \  (he's reading, she asks about his book). Conversation builds. By\n  landing they've\
  \ shared more than either expected. Customs separates\n  them. He kicks himself\
  \ for months.\n- ACT 2A: Three months later. He finds her on Instagram via a Mexico\n\
  \  City food photo she tagged. Sends a message referencing something\n  only she'd\
  \ remember. She responds. Texting becomes calls becomes\n  video becomes the first\
  \ thing he checks every morning.\n- ACT 2B: The digital relationship deepens but\
  \ strains. Time zones\n  make everything harder. They have their first real fight\
  \ over text\n  (the worst medium). He almost flies to Romania impulsively. She\n\
  \  talks him out of it — then regrets it.\n- ACT 3: One of them buys a ticket. The\
  \ reunion is nothing like\n  either imagined — it's awkward and weird and perfect.\
  \ The real\n  person is different from the voice on the phone. They have to\n  decide\
  \ if the real version is enough.\n"

protagonist: 'Ethan Reeves, 29. American software engineer from Austin, Texas. Dry
  humor, overthinks everything, hasn''t taken a real vacation in three years. His
  friends call him "the robot" because he plans every hour of every day. Secretly
  writes bad poetry in his Notes app. Went to Mexico because his therapist told him
  to do one unplanned thing.

  '
setting: 'Begins on a flight from Dallas to Mexico City (3.5 hours, economy class,
  middle and window seat). Then Mexico City for a week. Then Austin, TX and Cluj-Napoca,
  Romania — connected by screens, voice notes, and the occasional 3am video call.
  Final act: one of them flies to the other.

  pacing_notes: 'Act 1 (0-20%): The flight. Contained, intimate, real-time pacing.
    Act 2A (20-45%): The search and reconnection. Faster pace, montage energy, texts
    and calls building. Act 2B (45-70%): Deep digital relationship and strain. Slower,
    more emotional, the cracks show. Act 3 (70-100%): The reunion and aftermath. Grounded,
    sensory, present-tense feeling even in past tense.

synopsis: 'Ethan, a burned-out software engineer, sits next to Ana on a flight to
  Mexico City. For 3.5 hours they talk about everything — failed relationships, the
  Romanian word for homesickness, why airport coffee is always terrible. When they
  land, the chaos of customs separates them. No numbers exchanged. No last names.
  Just a first name and an accent he can''t stop hearing in his head. Three months
  later, Ethan finds her Instagram through a Mexico City geotag. He sends a message.
  She replies. What follows is a love story told across time zones, voice notes, and
  the terrifying question: is it worth crossing an ocean for someone you''ve spent
  exactly 3.5 hours with?

  '
target_length: standard (60k)
themes: 'The courage to pursue something irrational. How we construct people in our
  heads vs who they actually are. Loneliness in the age of connection. Home as a person,
  not a place.

  '
title: Seat 27B
tone: Warm, funny, aching, modern. Think Sally Rooney meets David Nicholls.
world_rules: 'Contemporary setting, 2024. Real places (Austin, Cluj-Napoca, Mexico
  City). Technology is realistic — WhatsApp, Instagram, FaceTime. Time zone math matters
  (Romania is 8 hours ahead of Austin). Flights, costs, visas are real constraints.
  No magical coincidences.

  '
writing_style: 'First person, Ethan''s POV. Sharp internal monologue, self-deprecating
  but not annoying. Short paragraphs for his overthinking, longer flowing passages
  for moments with Ana. Dialogue should feel real — people interrupting each other,
  half-finished sentences, laughter mid-word. Include texts and voice note transcripts
  formatted naturally.
