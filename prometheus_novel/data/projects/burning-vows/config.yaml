antagonist: 'Not a traditional antagonist—the conflict is internal. The "antagonist"
  is Lena''s own fear of vulnerability and Marco''s guilt over his younger brother''s
  death. Secondary tension from Marco''s overbearing mother Gianna who disapproves
  of Lena, and the secret that Lena was handling divorce papers for the groom''s parents
  when she first met Marco.

avoid: '- AI tells: "I couldn''t help but", "I found myself", "suddenly", "a whirlwind
  of emotions" - Purple prose: "electricity coursed through", "my heart skipped a
  beat" - Generic descriptions: "handsome", "beautiful", use SPECIFIC details instead
  - Instant love—this is SLOW BURN. Resistance must feel earned. - Passive heroines—Lena
  is ACTIVE, makes choices, has agency - Love triangle clichés - "Not like other girls"
  framing - Slut-shaming or judgment of sexual choices

synopsis: 'Lena Castillo, a sharp-tongued divorce attorney who stopped believing in
  love after watching her parents'' marriage implode, is forced to co-plan her best
  friend''s destination wedding in the coastal hills of Amalfi with the one man she
  can''t stand— Marco Vitale, the groom''s infuriatingly charming Italian-American
  best man who also happens to be the guy she had a devastating one-night stand with
  three years ago that neither of them has ever spoken about. As two weeks of forced
  proximity in sun-soaked villas, shared balconies, and wine-fueled rehearsal dinners
  tear down their walls, Lena discovers Marco isn''t the careless playboy she assumed—he''s
  a man haunted by a family tragedy that mirrors her own deepest fear. But when a
  secret from their shared past threatens to destroy the wedding and their fragile
  new trust, Lena must choose between the safe cynicism that protects her and the
  terrifying vulnerability that real love demands.

writing_style: 'First person, Lena''s POV. Sharp, witty internal voice that cracks
  when emotions get real. Short punchy sentences for tension, longer flowing ones
  for sensual moments. Heavy on sensory detail—taste, smell, texture. Dialogue-driven
  with subtext. Internal monologue that''s self-aware and sometimes self-deprecating.
  Physical awareness of Marco rendered in precise, specific detail (not generic).

    A sharp-tongued divorce attorney who stopped believing in love. A devastatingly
    charming best man she shared one unforgettable night with three years ago. Two
    weeks of forced proximity on the sun-drenched Amalfi Coast, co-planning a wedding
    neither of them can escape. As golden afternoons in lemon groves and stolen
    moments on moonlit balconies tear down her walls, Lena discovers Marco isn't
    the careless playboy she told herself he was—he's a man haunted by a loss that
    mirrors her deepest fear. But when a secret from their past threatens to destroy
    everything, Lena must choose: the safe cynicism that protects her, or the
    terrifying leap that real love demands.
