antagonist: Elias Rourke (LOVE INTEREST), early 30s, Registry field investigator.
  Controlled, principled, unnervingly observant. He believes order prevents catastrophe,
  until Lena forces him to confront what "order" costs. Their tension should feel
  like two blades held too close.
avoid: No meta commentary. No "Here is…". No lists in prose. No generic vague hooks.
  No filler phrases like "everything changes" or "nothing is as it seems."
budget_usd: 0
central_conflict: Lena must retrieve proof of her brother's existence before the Registry
  permanently deletes the last trace, while Elias closes in, torn between duty and
  the growing certainty that the system is manufacturing "reality."
central_question: If your memories can be seized and edited, what does it mean to
  choose someone, or to be chosen?
genre: Romantic Suspense (with light speculative edge)
influences: Romantic suspense pacing, intimate psychological realism, noir coastal
  atmosphere.
key_locations: '- The Glass Registry (white marble, cold light, constant hush)

  - Aruq Lighthouse (abandoned, wind-screamed, rumored dead drop site)

  - Marrow Bay Ferry Terminal (commuter crowds, diesel, gulls)

  - The Salt Market (vendors, brine barrels, whispered side deals)

  - Tideglass Rooftop Bar (rich people, surveillance, romantic pressure-cooker)

  - The Shipbreaker Yards (sparks, shadows, hard confessions)'
key_plot_points: '- Inciting Incident: Lena sees a familiar phrase in a new intake
  file that only her brother used to say.

  - First Act Turn: she breaks protocol and pulls her sealed archival key, triggering
  an internal alarm.

  - Midpoint Twist: the mirror-tech shard shows Elias in one of her brother''s redacted
  memories, but not as the villain she expected.

  - Dark Night: Lena learns the Registry didn''t just erase the brother, it edited
  her emotional history with him.

  - Climax: confrontation at Aruq Lighthouse where the final shard can be played once,
  and only once, before it burns out.

  - Resolution: Lena chooses a truth that costs her something real, not a neat win.'

  rusted shipyards live beside sleek civic towers. The city runs on "Memory Tax" policies:

synopsis: A woman who processes other people's memories for a government archive discovers
  the state has been quietly erasing her own — and the investigator sent to stop
  her is the only person who believes she's telling the truth.
target_length: novella (30k)
themes: Consent, identity, manufactured reality, the ethics of safety, love as recognition.
title: The Glass Registry
tone: Tense, intimate, sensory, morally charged. Romantic tension is the primary engine.
world_rules: '1) The Glass Registry is a government-run archive that can legally seize,
  store, and redact memories tied to "public risk."

  2) Redactions leave "glare gaps": sensory blanks that people unconsciously try to
  fill with false certainty.

  3) Illegal "mirror tech" can replay redacted memories, but only in fractured, unreliable
  shards.

  4) Physical objects can trigger partial recall (salt, glass, music), but never the
  full truth at once.'
writing_style: Close first-person (Lena), present tense. Clean but lyrical. Sensory
  grounding (salt air, cold marble light, diesel, glass glare). Subtext-heavy dialogue.
