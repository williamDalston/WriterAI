The lounge looks like a nightclub designed by someone afraid of silence.

I step through the hatch and the air changes—warmer, drier, carrying synthetic vanilla and something underneath that reminds me of hotel lobbies at three in the morning. Velvet couches the color of old bruises line the walls. Amber emergency lights cast everything in gold that doesn't quite hide the rust at the seams where bulkheads meet floor. A mirror spans the far wall, floor to ceiling, and I catch my reflection before I can look away. The angle is wrong. Makes my jaw too sharp, my eyes too hollow.

"Welcome to the Velvet Lounge." The voice comes from everywhere at once, smooth and modulated like a radio host who's never had a bad day. "Authenticity detected. Jax Vale. Linnea Shaw. Elena Vance."

Jax stops walking. "It knows our names."

"MOTHER," Linnea says. She moves past me toward a console embedded in the wall, her fingers already reaching for the interface. "The habitat's AI. She manages life support, communications, environmental controls." She taps something and the lights shift warmer. "And she's very good at making introductions."

"MOTHER," Jax repeats. He's staring up at the ceiling like he expects to see a face. "That's—is that supposed to be comforting?"

"It's supposed to be efficient." Linnea doesn't look at him. Her attention stays on the screen, scrolling through menus I can't read from here. "Silas wanted something that felt personal. A presence, not just a system."

I watch her fingers move. Fast, confident, the way someone touches something they built. She's showing off.

"Ms. Shaw designed the social spaces," I say. My voice comes out too measured, the tone I use when I need someone to feel included. "The lounge, the observation decks, the dining areas."

Linnea glances back at me. Her smile has edges. "I designed the flow. How people move through the habitat, where they gather, what they see." She gestures at the mirror wall. "Sight lines matter. So does reflection."

Jax is still staring at the mirror. He takes a step closer, then stops. "Why is it—it's like a funhouse thing. I look weird."

"You look fine," I say automatically.

"No, like—" He tilts his head, frowning at his own image. "My face looks different. Off."

Linnea's smile widens. "The curve is intentional. Slight distortion. Makes people more aware of themselves." She taps the console again and the ambient sound shifts—something low and rhythmic I can't quite identify. "Silas wanted the lounge to feel intimate. Confessional."

The word lands wrong. I move toward the seating area, putting distance between myself and the mirror. "Jax, we should get you set up. MOTHER, can you activate the recording interface?"

"Recording parameters require user consent," MOTHER says. Her voice is pleasant, unhurried. "Jax Vale, do you consent to audiovisual capture?"

Jax looks at me. His thumb scrapes against his index finger, once. "Yeah. Sure."

A red light blinks to life above the center booth. The velvet there is deeper, almost black, and the way the light hits it makes the space look smaller than it is.

"Have a seat," I tell him. "We'll do something unscripted. Just you talking about why you're here, what you hope to learn."

"Unscripted," Jax echoes. He doesn't move toward the booth. "Like—what do I say?"

"Whatever feels true." I gesture at the seat. "No performance. Just Jax."

He laughs, sharp and too loud. "Right. Just Jax. Because that's gone so well for me lately."

Linnea is watching us, her hand resting on the console. "The booth is optimized for single-subject capture. Lighting, acoustics, even the seat angle—it's all designed to make the subject feel held." She pauses. "Silas was very specific about that word. Held."

I don't like the way she says it. I don't like the way Jax is looking at the booth like it's a trap he's supposed to walk into willingly.

"Elena." Mara's voice cuts through from the hatch behind us. I didn't hear her come in. She stands near the threshold, arms crossed, her posture rigid in a way that makes the space feel smaller. "We need to establish protocols. Who has access to this footage?"

"Standard release," I say. "Jax retains approval rights. Nothing goes out without his sign-off."

"And internal review?" Mara's eyes are on the red light, not on me. "Who sees it before he does?"

Linnea's fingers move across the console. "MOTHER archives everything. Silas has admin access. Standard security clearance."

"That's not what I asked."

The air in the lounge feels thicker. I count two seconds of silence, then step between them. "Captain, I understand your concern. We'll draft a formal agreement before any content is distributed. Right now, we're just establishing baseline material."

Mara's jaw tightens. She doesn't uncross her arms. "Baseline material that gets stored where? On local servers? Cloud backup?"

"Local," Linnea says. Her voice has gone flat, defensive. "Everything stays in the habitat unless explicitly transferred. That's part of the saturation protocol. No external access during the dive."

Jax finally moves toward the booth. He sits slowly, like he's testing the cushion for something hidden. The red light casts my face in shadow and highlight at once. He looks younger. More breakable.

I pull out my notebook. Small, leather-bound, the kind that fits in a jacket pocket. I flip to a blank page and start writing.

*Jax: needs validation more than he needs truth. Will perform if he thinks the camera loves him. Weakness: approval. Leverage: make him feel seen.*

*Linnea: territorial about her designs. Wants credit, wants control. Weakness: pride. Leverage: praise her vision, let her think she's leading.*

*Mara: doesn't trust media, doesn't trust me. Sees this whole thing as a liability. Weakness: protocol. Leverage: none yet.*

I write quickly, keeping my handwriting small. When I look up, Jax is staring into the camera lens. His expression is blank, waiting.

"Whenever you're ready," I say.

He opens his mouth. Closes it. His thumbnail finds his cuticle and he catches himself, drops my hand to his lap. "I don't—what do you want me to say?"

"Why you're here."

"Because my publicist told me to be here."

"Why you agreed."

His face does something I can't read. "Because I fucked up. Because people got hurt and I—" He stops. Swallows. "Because I want to do better. I want to be better. I just don't know if I know how."

The lounge is quiet except for the low hum of ventilation. Linnea is watching him with an expression I recognize—the look of someone cataloging material.

I don't write down what he said. I write: *Jax: honest when he's scared. Use that.*

"Good," I tell him. "That's good. Keep going."

But I'm not watching Jax anymore. I'm watching the mirror wall, and the angle that makes my face look like someone else's, and the red light that's supposed to be pointing at him but from where I'm standing looks like it's pointing at me.

MOTHER's voice fills the lounge again, soft and pleased. "Preliminary assessment complete. Flagged for secondary review."

"What does that mean?" I ask.

No one answers.

I look at Linnea. She's staring at her console, her fingers still against the edge. She doesn't meet my eyes.

The control I thought I had—the setup, the framing, the careful positioning of Jax in the booth while I stood outside the shot—feels thin. Like a script someone else wrote and I've been reading without checking the stage directions.

I step toward the console. "Linnea. What does 'flagged for secondary review' mean?"

She doesn't look up. Her fingers lift, hover, drop. When she finally speaks, her voice is careful, like she's reading from a script she memorized poorly. "It means MOTHER identified something worth analyzing. Biometric data, vocal patterns, behavioral markers." She taps the screen once, and the red light above Jax's booth goes dark. Another light blinks on—small, recessed in the ceiling directly above where I'm standing. "The system prioritizes whoever shows the most interesting response to stimulus. In this case—" She finally meets my eyes. "That wasn't Jax."

I wake to the sound of the walls remembering they're walls.

The groan comes from somewhere deep in the habitat's spine—metal flexing under pressure, or maybe settling into its own weight. I lie still in the narrow bunk, counting the seconds between creaks. Twelve. Fifteen. Nine. No pattern. Just the ocean reminding us it's holding us down here.

The air tastes recycled. Flat. Like breathing through someone else's lungs.

I swing my legs off the bunk and my feet meet cold steel. The floor vibrates with machinery I can't see—pumps, scrubbers, the constant work of keeping us alive. Emergency lighting strips the cabin in rust-colored glow and shadow. My clothes are where I left them, folded on the chair that doubles as a desk. I pull on pants and a shirt that still smell faintly of the surface. Diesel and open sky. Things that don't exist down here.

The condensation on the viewport has gotten worse. Droplets trace slow paths down the glass, merging into larger beads that hang for a moment before falling. I press my palm against the metal frame. Cold. Everything here is cold or pretending not to be.

Two breaths in. Four out. The technique is supposed to calm me. Instead it just makes me aware of how deliberately I'm trying to stay calm.

I leave my cabin and step into the spine corridor. The overhead lights flicker once, twice, then hold. Rust-colored strips run along the baseboards like a path marked for evacuation. But there's nowhere to evacuate to. Just more corridor. More pressure. More ocean.

Jax's cabin is three doors down. I knock once, light, and the door slides open immediately. He's dressed. Sitting on his bunk with my back against the wall and my knees drawn up. His thumbnail works at the edge of his index finger, scraping skin that's already raw.

"Can't sleep either?" My voice is rough.

"The walls are loud."

"Yeah." He drops his hands. "Mara said that's normal. The habitat shifts. Thermal contraction or something. She used words I didn't understand."

I lean against the doorframe. The corridor behind me smells like metal and something organic I can't place. Algae, maybe. Or mold starting somewhere we can't reach.

"You want to come in?" he asks.

"No."

"Okay."

I watch a droplet form on the ceiling above his bunk. It hangs there, growing heavier, until gravity wins and it falls onto his pillow. He doesn't move to wipe it away.

"You should try to sleep," I say.

"You first."

I push off the doorframe and the door slides shut before I can respond. The corridor stretches in both directions, identical except for the cabin numbers. I turn left because it doesn't matter.

My cabin feels smaller when I return. The bunk, the chair, the viewport with its condensation. I sit on the floor instead, back against the wall, and watch the water on the glass. Each droplet follows a path carved by the ones before it. Predictable. Controlled by physics I don't need to understand.

I count breaths. Two in, four out. Again. Again.

My hands are cold. They're always cold down here.

The lights go out.

Not flickering. Not dimming. Just gone. The rust-colored strips stay lit for three seconds, then those die too. The darkness is complete. No ambient glow from the corridor. No light from the viewport. Nothing.

I don't move. My back stays against the wall. My lungs fill and empty in the rhythm I've been forcing.

Then the door to my cabin slides open.

I didn't touch the panel. Didn't call for MOTHER. The door just opens, smooth and mechanical, and the corridor beyond is as dark as my cabin. No emergency lighting. No colored strips.

Someone is breathing in the doorway.

Not me. Not my breath. Someone else's. Steady and controlled, like they've been standing there for a while. Waiting for the lights to die.

I press my spine harder against the wall. My throat closes around the question I should ask. The air between us smells like antiseptic and metal.

The breathing continues. In. Out. Patient.

I count the space between us in heartbeats. Four. Five. Six.

Then a voice, low and precise: "You should be more careful about locking your door."

The lights snap back on. Rust-colored glow floods the corridor.

Aris Kade stands in my doorway, one hand resting on the frame. His face is calm. His eyes are tired. He looks at me the way someone looks at a problem they've already solved.

"MOTHER had a minor power routing issue," he says. "Backup systems engaged. Everything's fine."

I don't believe him.

He doesn't wait for me to respond. Just steps back and lets the door slide shut between us. His footsteps fade down the corridor, even and unhurried.

I sit on the floor and count breaths until morning.
