# Chapter 3 — LOCKED

## ch03_s01 (Velvet Lounge) — 1321 words

The first jolt comes while I'm washing my face in the narrow sink.

The bulkhead beneath my palm shifts. Not a vibration—a lurch. Like the floor decided to drop half an inch before remembering it shouldn't. Water sloshes against the basin rim. I grip the edge and count. One. Two. Three.

Nothing.

I dry my hands on the thin towel and step into the corridor. The overhead lights are steady. No alarm. No voices. Maybe I imagined—

The second hit throws me sideways into the wall.

This one's bigger. The entire structure groans, a deep metallic scrape that starts somewhere above and runs through the spine like a shudder. Emergency lighting flickers on—rust-colored strips along the baseboards casting everything in amber and shadow. I hear something crack. Not close. Deeper in the habitat. A sound like ice breaking on a frozen lake.

I move toward the lounge. My training kicks in before thought does. Find people. Keep them calm. Get information.

The corridor tilts. Just slightly. Enough that I notice my weight shifting toward the outer wall. I press forward, one hand trailing the bulkhead for balance.

The lounge hatch is open. Inside, chaos.

Jax is halfway out of the velvet booth, one hand braced on the table. Across the room, Linnea stands frozen near the viewport, both palms flat against the glass. Three other guests I haven't learned the names of yet cluster near the bar. One of them is crying. Another keeps tapping his tablet like the screen will suddenly connect.

"What's happening?" The woman near the bar has her arms wrapped around herself. "Is this normal? Does this happen?"

I open my mouth to answer and the third jolt hits.

This one doesn't stop.

The floor drops. Not metaphorically. Actually drops. My stomach lurches as the entire lounge tilts ten degrees to port. The crystal chandelier above the center table swings wide, its chains groaning. Glasses slide off the bar and shatter. Someone screams.

I grab the doorframe. The tilt keeps going. Fifteen degrees. Twenty.

"Hold onto something!" Linnea's voice cuts across the noise. She's still at the viewport, knuckles locked. "Don't move toward the outer wall!"

The man with the tablet stumbles. I lunge forward and catch his elbow, haul him back toward the inner bulkhead. He's heavier than he looks. My shoulder hits the wall and I wedge us both there.

"Wi-Fi," he says. His eyes are glassy. "I need to tell my wife—"

"Later." I keep my voice flat. "Right now, brace."

The groaning intensifies. It's coming from everywhere—the walls, the ceiling, the floor. Like the habitat is a living thing in pain. I can feel it through the soles of my feet. A vibration so deep it makes my teeth ache.

Then it stops.

The tilt holds at twenty-three degrees—I know because the emergency guideline painted on the wall near the hatch is now diagonal. The groaning fades to a low, continuous hum. Background noise. Almost worse than the screaming metal.

Silence settles. The kind that presses on your eardrums.

"Everyone okay?" My voice sounds too loud. I scan the room. Jax is still in the booth, both hands gripping the table edge. Linnea hasn't moved from the viewport. The crying woman has stopped crying. She's just staring at the floor like it betrayed her.

"What the hell was that?" Jax's question hangs in the air.

Before I can answer, the lights cut.

Not flickering. Not dimming. Just gone.

The amber emergency strips stay on—barely. They cast everything in sepia, like an old photograph. The kind where you can't tell if people are alive or just holding very still.

I wait for the backup systems to kick in. They don't.

The hum beneath us changes pitch. Lower. Slower. Something winding down.

"Elena." Linnea's voice is careful. Too careful. "Look."

I cross to the viewport, moving sideways along the wall. The angle makes it awkward. When I reach her, I follow her gaze.

Outside, in the black water, the tether cable is wrong.

It takes me a moment to understand what I'm seeing. The main line should be taut—a vertical column disappearing up into darkness. Instead, it's slack. Drifting. The upper section is gone.

Just gone.

"We dropped." Linnea's breath fogs the glass. "The tether snapped. We're not at six hundred feet anymore."

I don't ask how deep. The question feels dangerous. Like speaking it will make the water outside press harder.

My hands are cold. Not the habitat cold—something under the skin, something that started before the first jolt and hasn’t stopped.

Behind us, someone starts hyperventilating. Quick, shallow gasps. I turn. The man with the tablet is bent over, hands on my knees.

"Breathe slower," I say. "You're wasting oxygen."

He looks up at me. His face is gray in the amber light. "Are we going to die?"

The truth sits behind my teeth—I don't know—but I can't say that. Not here. Not with six pairs of eyes on me. If I lose them now, if I admit I'm as lost as they are, there's no getting them back.

"We're going to find the captain," I say. "Stay here. Don't touch anything."

Jax stands. "I'm coming with you."

"No—"

"I'm coming." His voice is steady. Steadier than I expected. "You need someone who won't panic."

I look at him. His hands are flexing open and closed at his sides, but his face is calm. The performance face. The one he wears when cameras are rolling.

"Fine." I move toward the hatch. "Linnea, keep them here. If the tilt gets worse, move everyone to the inner corridor."

She nods. Doesn't argue. That scares me more than the drop.

The corridor outside is darker. The emergency strips are spaced farther apart here, leaving gaps of shadow. I move toward the command junction, one hand on the wall. Jax follows close. Too close. I can hear his breathing.

Halfway there, we find Aris.

He's standing at the control panel near the junction. His back is to us. Both hands rest on the console. He's not moving.

"Aris." I keep my voice level. "What happened?"

He doesn't turn. "Tether failure. Primary anchor gave way."

"I can see that." I step closer. "What I'm asking is why."

"Unknown." He taps something on the screen. The display is dim—running on backup power. "Diagnostics are offline."

"So bring them online."

"Working on it." His voice is clipped. Professional. But there's something underneath. Something tight.

I move around to see his face. He's pale. Sweat beads his upper lip.

"Where's Mara?" I ask.

"Main hatch. Checking hull integrity." He finally looks at me. His eyes are flat. "In case we need to seal sections."

"Seal sections." I repeat the words slowly. "You mean in case we're flooding."

"In case of breach." He turns back to the console. "Which we're not. Yet."

Jax shifts beside me. "So we just… wait?"

"We wait." Aris pulls up another screen. "Backup systems should initialize in ten minutes. Then we'll know how bad it is."

I stare at the panel. The display shows a schematic of the habitat—a cutaway diagram with sections labeled. Most of them are gray. Offline. Only three show green: the lounge, the med bay, and the command junction where we're standing.

"What about MOTHER?" I ask.

Aris's jaw tightens. "She's not responding."

"Not responding or offline?"

"I don't know." He types something. The screen flickers. "Her core systems are separate. She should have rebooted by now."

"Should have." I lean against the wall. The tilt makes standing upright feel wrong. Like my body knows the floor isn't where it's supposed to be. "That's not reassuring."

"I'm not here to reassure you." Aris glances at me. "I'm here to keep you alive."

The words land cold. Final.

Jax clears her throat. "So… ten minutes. Then what?"

"Then we find out if we're stuck." Aris turns back to the console. "Or if we're sinking."

## ch03_s02 (Command panel area) — 964 words

The red recording light blinks twice, then dies.

I stare at the console where Aris just stood. The timer still counts down—eight minutes, forty-three seconds. Everyone else has scattered. Mara went to check the bulkhead seals. Silas followed her, voice tight with demands about liability protocols. Linnea muttered something about checking her blueprints and disappeared through the hatch. Jax lingered near the viewport for a moment, fingers drumming against the acrylic, then left without looking back.

The lounge feels too large now. Too quiet except for the hum of the ventilation system and the faint creak of the habitat settling against the pressure outside.

I move to the communications panel. The dark screen reflects my face back at me—pale, controlled. I press the activation key.

Nothing.

I try again. Hold it longer this time.

The screen flickers. MOTHER's interface loads in segments, slower than before. The familiar teal glow fills the display, but something about it feels hollow.

"MOTHER, run a diagnostic on external communications."

The response comes after a three-second delay.

COMMUNICATIONS: UNAVAILABLE

"Define unavailable."

COMMUNICATIONS: UNAVAILABLE

I flex my fingers and try a different approach. "Show me the last successful surface contact."

The screen shifts. A log appears—timestamps in military format. The most recent entry is from six hours ago. A routine status update to the mainland facility. Confirmation of our arrival. All systems nominal.

"Attempt contact now."

COMMUNICATIONS: UNAVAILABLE

"Why?"

COMMUNICATIONS: UNAVAILABLE

I pull up the system architecture Linnea showed me during the tour—the redundant arrays, the backup transponders, the emergency beacon that's supposed to activate automatically if primary systems fail. Everything looks intact on the schematic. Green indicators across the board.

But the red recording light is dead.

The hatch opens behind me. I don't turn.

"Still trying?" Aris's voice carries no inflection.

"There should be a backup." I keep my eyes on the screen. "Multiple backups."

"There are." He moves to stand beside me. Close enough that I can smell the antiseptic edge to him. "They're all offline."

"Simultaneously?"

"Apparently."

I look at him. "That's not how redundancy works."

"No." He reaches past me and keys in a command sequence. The schematic disappears. In its place, a new timer appears—yellow this time, smaller. The numbers are already at zero.

My throat tightens. "What is that?"

"The backup beacon." He straightens. "It should have activated when primary communications failed. It didn't."

"So fix it."

"I can't." He wipes his palms against his thighs. Once. Precise. "The trigger mechanism is external. Outside the habitat."

The ventilation hum seems louder now. I count two breaths. "Someone would have to go out there."

"In a dive suit. At six hundred feet. In the dark." He glances at the main timer. Seven minutes, twelve seconds. "And we'd need to decompress them first. That's hours we don't have."

"Then what's the point of the timer?"

"To see if surface protocol kicks in when we miss our next scheduled check-in." His tone is clinical. Detached. "Standard operating procedure says they send a rescue team if we go dark for more than twelve hours."

"Twelve hours."

"Assuming they notice. Assuming the weather holds. Assuming the equipment on their end is working." He turns toward the hatch. "Assuming a lot of things."

I catch his wrist. His skin is warm under my fingers. "What happens when the red timer reaches zero?"

He looks down at my hand. Doesn't pull away. "We find out if the hull integrity is stable."

"And if it's not?"

"Then the twelve hours won't matter."

He slides his wrist free—gentle, deliberate—and walks to the hatch. His footsteps are even. Unhurried. Like we're discussing maintenance schedules instead of drowning.

The hatch seals behind him.

I turn back to the console. The yellow timer stares at me. 00:00:00. The red one counts down. Six minutes, eighteen seconds.

"MOTHER, probability of rescue within twelve hours."

YOUR HEART RATE IS 94 BPM, ELENA. YOU ALREADY KNOW.

"That's not what I asked."

COMMUNICATIONS: UNAVAILABLE

The edge of the console is cold and slightly damp under my palms. Condensation from the recycled air. I think about the surface. The dock where we boarded. The cameras Silas arranged. The whole world watching us descend.

Nobody watching us now.

The red timer hits six minutes flat.

I smooth my sleeves. The fabric feels thin. Inadequate.

"MOTHER, show me current air quality readings."

The screen shifts. Numbers appear. CO₂ levels are elevated but within tolerance. Oxygen at ninety-four percent. Temperature holding steady at eighteen degrees Celsius.

All systems nominal.

Except the ones that let us talk to anyone who isn't already trapped down here with us.

The lounge is too quiet. I hear my own breathing. The faint electric buzz from the bioluminescent panels Linnea embedded in the walls. The ocean pressing against the acrylic viewports—not a sound, exactly, but a presence. A weight.

The red timer drops below five minutes.

I count breaths. Two in, four out. The way I learned when I was twenty-six and had to walk into a boardroom full of lawyers who wanted to watch me break.

I didn't break then.

The lights go out.

Not slowly. Not flickering. Just gone—all at once, like someone flipped a switch. The console screen dies mid-display. The bioluminescent glow vanishes. Even the emergency strips along the floor go dark.

Total blackness.

I can't see my hands. Can't see the viewport or the walls or the hatch. Can't see anything except the faint afterimage of the timer burned into my vision.

04:47

Then that fades too.

I stand in the dark and wait for my eyes to adjust. They don't. There's nothing to adjust to. No light source. No ambient glow. Just pressure and silence and the taste of recycled air turning stale in my mouth.

Somewhere in the habitat, someone screams.
