# Chapter 4 — LOCKED

## ch04_s01 (Life Support Bay) — 917 words

The oxygen sensor reads 19.4%. I stare at the number until it blurs into static. My eyes hurt. Everything hurts—temples, jaw, the space behind my ribs where breath should go easy.

Someone stands at the scrubber panel, back to me. Still. Precise. The kind of stillness that counts seconds. Aris. He's been silent for three minutes. I know because I've been counting. Two breaths in, four out. The rhythm doesn't help anymore.

"Show me again," I say.

He doesn't turn. My fingers move across the screen, pulling up the log. "CO₂ at 0.8%. Rising point-zero-two per hour. Scrubbers are running at capacity."

"That's within tolerance."

"For now." He taps the projection forward. The curve steepens. "Twelve hours, we hit 1.2%. Cognitive impairment. Twenty-four hours, 1.5%. That's when people stop making good decisions."

I step closer. The numbers don't lie, but the way he's presenting them does. "You're assuming constant consumption. We can reduce activity, lower metabolic demand—"

"I'm assuming eight people breathing." My voice is flat. Clinical. "Unless you have another plan."

The air tastes like copper. I swallow and it catches in my throat. "The emergency reserves—"

"Are emergency reserves. We use those, we have nothing for decompression. You want to explain to Silas why we can't leave when rescue arrives?"

I press my hands against my thighs. Feel the fabric of my pants, the muscle underneath. Concrete. Real. "Then we ration activity. Limit movement to essential tasks. Everyone stays in their quarters except—"

"Except what?" Now he turns. My eyes are red-rimmed, exhausted. "Except meals? Except monitoring systems? Except checking for the next thing that breaks?"

I hold my gaze. "You're the environmental specialist. Tell me what we do."

"I just did." He wipes his palms on his pants. Once. Twice. "We reduce headcount or we reduce time. Those are the variables."

The words sit between us like a third presence. I count my breaths again but lose track at four.

"You're saying someone needs to leave."

"I'm saying the math doesn't care about fairness." He pulls up another screen. "Look. Here's consumption by individual. Silas, highest metabolic rate. Jax, second. Mara's efficient, Linnea too. Priya's small, uses less. You're—" He stops.

"I'm what?"

His finger hovers over my name on the list. "Average. Exactly average. Like you're designed to disappear into data."

The observation lands wrong. Too specific. Too much like he's been watching.

"What's your point?"

"My point is that someone engineered this situation. Someone who understands systems." He closes the projection. "Someone who knows how to make a crisis look like an accident."

The temperature in the bay hasn't changed but my skin feels hot. "You think I did this."

"I think you fix problems for a living. I think you're very good at managing outcomes." He crosses his arms. "I think if someone wanted to create a controlled disaster for publicity, you'd know how."

The accusation should make me angry. Instead, I feel something colder. Calculation. He's testing me. Watching for the reaction that confirms guilt.

I don't give him one.

"If I wanted publicity, I wouldn't be stuck down here suffocating with you." I turn to the oxygen readout. "I'd be topside, spinning the story. That's how it works."

"Maybe." He moves to the scrubber housing, checks a gauge I can't see from here. "Or maybe the story's better if you're in it. The PR specialist who survived the disaster she helped create. Very marketable."

My teeth press together. Hard enough that pain shoots up into my skull.

My gaze drops to my mouth. Holds there. "Interesting reflex," he says. Quiet. Like he's filing it.

"You want a confession?"

"I want the truth."

"The truth is we have twelve hours before people stop thinking clearly. Including you." I meet my eyes. "So either help me find a solution or get out of my way."

For a moment, he doesn't move. Then something shifts in his expression—not softening, but recalculating.

"MOTHER," he says. "Environmental status report."

The AI's voice fills the bay, calm and neutral. "Current atmospheric composition within acceptable parameters. CO₂ at 0.81%, rising. Scrubber efficiency at 94%. Recommend reduced physical activity and increased rest intervals."

"Increased rest intervals," I repeat. "That's your solution? Tell eight terrified people to take a nap?"

"It's a start." He pulls up a scheduling grid. "Rotating shifts. Two people active at a time, six resting. Cuts consumption by sixty percent."

The math works. I hate that it works.

"Silas won't agree to it."

"Silas doesn't get a vote." He saves the schedule, sends it to the main terminal. "This is environmental protocol. I have override authority."

"That'll go over well."

"I don't need it to go over well. I need people to stay alive." He finally looks at me straight-on. "Unless you have a better pitch."

I don't. The realization sits heavy in my chest, crowding out what little air I have left.

"Fine. I'll tell them." I turn toward the hatch. My tablet chimes before I reach it.

The alert is simple. Two words in red text.

AIRLOCK BREACH—SECTION SEVEN.

I pull up the schematic. Section Seven. The docking port. Where we came in.

Aris is already moving, pulling up the sensor feed on his own screen. His face goes white. "That's not a breach. That's a manual override. Someone opened it from the inside." He looks at me, and for the first time since we started this conversation, I see actual fear. "Elena—how many people did you say were in their quarters?"

## ch04_s02 (Command junction corridor) — 1127 words

I step into the Velvet Lounge and count seven faces turned toward the doorway. Silas stands near the viewport, shoulders back, chin level—the posture he holds for conference stages. Mara leans against the bar, arms locked across her chest. Linnea perches on a chair's edge, one knee bouncing. Priya sits rigid on the couch, hands pressed flat against the cushions. Jax slouches near the wall, thumbnail working at the corner of his index finger. By the life support panel beside the hatch, someone waits—hands folded behind my back, the stance of a man who's already decided how this ends. Aris.

"We need to make a statement." Silas's voice fills the room the way it always does, calibrated for spaces three times this size. "Something that establishes unity. A message that we're handling this together."

Mara doesn't move. "There's no one out there listening."

"Not yet. But when communications restore—"

"If they restore." Linnea's knee stops bouncing. "We don't know what caused the failure."

Silas touches his left cuff, smooths it once. "Which is exactly why we need to control the narrative now. Before speculation takes root."

I recognize the rhythm. He's pitching. Selling a vision to an audience that doesn't exist anymore. The cameras are gone but he can't stop performing.

"Control what narrative?" Jax straightens against the wall. "We're six hundred feet underwater with failing systems and no way to call for help. What story are we supposed to tell ourselves?"

"The one that keeps us functional." Silas turns from the viewport. His eyes lock onto mine. "Elena understands this. Don't you?"

The room shifts. Everyone looks at me.

I keep my face still. "I understand that panic spreads through information vacuums. But Mara's right. There's no external audience right now."

"Then we're the audience." Silas moves closer. "And someone needs to explain why our systems are failing in sequence. Why the air math doesn't add up. Why we're being told to ration oxygen when we should have reserves for weeks."

Aris speaks without turning from the panel. "The math is accurate."

"Is it?" Silas doesn't look at him. Still watching me. "Because Elena seems to think there's a discrepancy. She made quite a compelling case earlier. Very... strategic."

The word sits in the air like a tripwire.

Priya lifts her head. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying someone with a background in crisis management knows exactly how to create one." Silas clasps his hands behind his back. "How to manufacture urgency. How to make people see threats that serve a particular agenda."

My throat goes tight. "That's not—"

"You questioned the numbers. You implied sabotage. You created suspicion where there was cooperation." My voice stays level, reasonable. "That's your skillset, isn't it? Shaping perception?"

Jax pushes off the wall. "She was trying to figure out what's wrong."

"Or trying to figure out how to position herself as indispensable." Silas tilts his head. "Crisis managers thrive in chaos. It's their natural habitat."

Linnea stands. "This is insane. We're turning on each other over—"

"Over what?" Silas spreads his hands. "Over legitimate questions? Elena raised concerns about the air supply. I'm raising concerns about her motives. Seems fair."

Mara steps forward. "Enough."

But the room has already fractured. I see it in the way Priya's shoulders lock, the way Linnea hugs herself. Even Jax looks uncertain now, my gaze jumping between me and Silas.

Aris finally turns from the panel. "The systems are functioning as designed. The math is correct. If there's a problem, it's human error. Someone's misunderstanding the parameters."

"Or someone's lying about them," Silas says quietly.

The temperature in the room drops. I feel it in my hands first, the way they always go cold when I'm cornered. I count. Two in. Four out. The technique doesn't help.

"I'm not lying." My voice comes out flat. "I found evidence of tampering."

"Did you?" Aris's expression doesn't change. "Or did you find normal wear patterns and decide they fit a narrative you needed?"

"That's not—"

"Because from where I'm standing, you're the one who benefits from crisis. You're the one who gets paid to solve problems." My head tilts slightly. "What happens when the problems run out?"

The accusation lands like a physical blow. I open my mouth but nothing comes.

Jax takes a step toward me. "Come on. That's not fair."

"Isn't it?" Silas looks around the room. "We're all trapped here together. Someone knows why. Someone's been playing games with our survival. And the person with the most experience manipulating truth is telling us to be afraid."

"I didn't—"

"You spun a story about sabotage based on scratches and residue that could mean anything. You made us doubt our own systems. Our own people." My voice drops to that intimate register he uses when he wants to sound sincere. "That's what you do, Elena. You make people see what you want them to see."

Priya stands. "This isn't productive."

"Neither is pretending we're all friends." Linnea moves toward the hatch. "I'm going back to my quarters."

"No one's going anywhere alone." Mara's hand rests on the emergency intercom. "We stay in groups. We stay calm. We figure this out without tearing each other apart."

But it's too late. The fracture is complete.

The lounge empties in ones and twos. Linnea first, then Priya. Mara escorts Silas out with a hand on my shoulder that looks protective but reads like custody. Jax lingers near the viewport, glances at me once, then follows.

I stand in the empty room. The velvet booths look absurd. Like costumes after the show ends.

MOTHER's voice breaks the silence. Not the advisory tone. Something softer.

YOUR CORTISOL HAS BEEN ELEVATED FOR FORTY-THREE MINUTES, ELENA. YOUR JAW TENSION SUGGESTS UNRESOLVED CONFLICT. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

I stare at the panel. "No."

The screen holds for a beat. Then:

UNDERSTOOD. BUT THE CONFLICT IS STILL THERE.

The words sit in the empty lounge like a mirror I didn't ask for.

Behind me, footsteps. I don't turn.

"They'll come around." Aris's voice. Close. Too close. "Once the air gets thinner, they'll stop caring who said what and start caring who can keep them alive."

"Is that supposed to be comforting?"

"It's supposed to be accurate." A pause. "You almost said something back there. When Silas pushed you. I saw it."

My hands go still. "I don't know what you mean."

"Yes you do." His voice drops. Not threatening. Curious. "Whatever it is, it's eating you faster than the CO₂."

He leaves. His footsteps are even. Unhurried. The hatch seals behind him.

I stand alone in the Velvet Lounge with MOTHER's question still glowing on the screen and the taste of something I almost said turning sour in my mouth.
