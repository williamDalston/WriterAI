The ocean air tastes like copper and diesel fuel.

I stand on the platform watching Silas Greer pose for cameras that aren't supposed to be here. My hand rests on Jax Vale's shoulder like a claim. The morning light catches the chrome railing, the polished hull of the submersible behind them, the logo embroidered on Silas's jacket—everything gleaming except Jax's face. He looks like he hasn't slept. Good. That reads as remorse.

"Elena." Silas doesn't turn. I pitch my voice to carry across the dock, practiced projection that makes the tech crew glance up from their equipment. "We were just discussing the descent protocol."

I cross the platform. My heels click against the grated metal, each step measured. "The press embargo was explicit. No cameras until we surface."

"Documentation," Silas says. He straightens his cuffs. "Internal use only. You understand the value of a proper record."

I understand that he's already reframing the terms we agreed on. The contract I negotiated gave me narrative control, but Silas treats contracts like opening bids. I count two breaths—in through my nose, out through my mouth—and let my silence do the work. The camera operator shifts his weight. The sound tech pretends to check a connection.

"Of course," Silas says smoothly. "We'll shelve the footage. Carla, pack it up."

Jax finally looks at me. His eyes have that red-rimmed glaze of someone who flew overnight and tried to fix it with eye drops. He opens his mouth, but I shake my head once. Whatever he wants to say, he can say it later. Preferably never.

"Mr. Vale needs to change." I keep my tone flat. "The dive suit fitting is in twenty minutes."

"Jax was just telling me about his mother's work with ocean conservation." Silas's smile doesn't reach his eyes. "Beautiful full-circle moment. From her advocacy to his transformation. We should explore that in the testimonial segments."

I smooth my sleeves. The fabric feels too tight against my wrists. "We're here for rehabilitation, not retrospectives."

"Rehabilitation is a story." Silas gestures toward the submersible. "And stories need context. Depth."

The word hangs there. Depth. He's good.

Jax picks at his thumbnail. "I just meant—my mom used to talk about coral restoration. It's not, like, a whole thing."

"Everything's a thing," Silas says. "That's why we brought Elena. To help us see the shape of it."

I don't correct him. He knows exactly what he's doing—testing how much I'll push back in front of the crew, in front of Jax, with the habitat waiting below us like a promise we've all already made. The diesel smell from the dock mixes with salt spray. Somewhere behind the equipment crates, someone laughs. The sound carries wrong in the wind.

"The fitting," I say again.

Silas nods, gracious in victory. "Of course. Jax, Elena will take care of you. She's very good at that."

Jax follows me toward the prep building. His footsteps sound uneven, like he's favoring his left ankle. When we're far enough from the cameras, he leans close.

"I need to tell you something about—"

"Not now."

"Elena, seriously, there's something off about—"

"Not. Now." I don't slow down. "You're here to be quiet and cooperative and demonstrate insight you may or may not actually feel. That's the job. Everything else is noise."

He stops walking. I keep going for three steps before I realize he's not following. When I turn back, he's staring at me with something that might be anger or might be fear. It's hard to tell with Jax. He spent so many years performing emotion that his real face looks like a mask.

"You don't even want to know what I'm going to say."

"I want you to get through the next six weeks without creating another crisis." My hands feel cold. They always do when I'm lying. "That's all I want."

He flexes his fingers open and closed. "Right. Yeah. Okay."

The prep building smells like rubber and disinfectant. Inside, a woman in a dive suit checks a tablet, and a man adjusts the straps on what looks like a vest made of monitors and sensors. Neither of them looks up when we enter. Professional disinterest, the kind you only get with serious money involved.

But someone else is watching.

He stands near the far wall, next to a console displaying depth readings and pressure gradients. Mid-forties, compact build, eyes that track me with the precision of someone who's already done the math. His jacket has a medical insignia. His hands rest at his sides, still and ready.

"Kade," the woman with the tablet says. "This is Ms. Vance and Mr. Vale. They're on the first descent."

"I know who they are." His voice is flat. Not hostile, not warm. Factual.

The way he says it makes my spine straighten. I know who they are. Not I've heard about them or We've been expecting them. He knows. Present tense. Active.

I meet his gaze and hold it. His expression doesn't change. He doesn't blink. Somewhere in the building, a vent hums. Jax shifts beside me, his shoulder brushing mine.

"Fitting takes thirty minutes," Kade says. "Then we pressurize. No delays."

"Understood."

He turns back to the console. Dismissal. But I feel his attention still on me, a weight that doesn't lift even when he's looking at the screen. Like he's been waiting for me to arrive. Like I'm late for an appointment I never made.

The woman gestures Jax toward the changing area. He goes without argument, for once. I stay in the doorway, watching Kade's reflection in the dark glass of the console. He doesn't move. Neither do I.

Then he glances back, just for a second. His eyes meet mine in the glass.

He smiles, and something in my chest goes cold. Not because the smile is unfriendly—I've handled unfriendly. But because it's knowing. Like he's already seen how this ends and he's curious whether I'll figure it out in time.

"Ms. Vance." His voice is quiet enough that the others won't hear. "When you go down, stay close to the guide rails. The habitat's layout can be disorienting for first-timers." He turns back to the console, fingers moving across the screen. "People get lost in the observation corridors. Start seeing things that aren't there." He taps something that makes the depth readings spike, then settle. "Pressure does strange things to perception."

The hatch seals behind us with a sound like a vault door. I count the bolts—eight—and the seconds it takes for the pressure gauge to stabilize. Twelve. The number matters because everything matters now.

Jax stands too close to the wall, one hand pressed flat against the steel like he's testing whether it's real. His thumbnail scrapes against his index finger, a rhythm I've already learned to recognize. The transfer chamber smells like rust and something sharper—ozone, maybe, or the particular chemistry of recycled air meeting salt water.

Mara moves through the space with the efficiency of someone who's done this five hundred times. She checks seals I can't identify, taps gauges I don't understand. Her uniform is different from the morning's pressed perfection—this one has pockets for tools, loops for tethers. Functional. Honest.

"Briefing plays in thirty seconds," she says. "Don't interrupt it."

Aris stands near the viewport, his back to us. Through the glass, water presses dark and absolute. No gradient. No light. Just depth.

A speaker crackles overhead. The voice that emerges is MOTHER's—warmer than I expected, almost maternal. "Welcome to Descent Protocol. You are currently at sea level. Aethelgard rests at six hundred feet. Transit time: forty minutes. Please remain seated during—"

"Saturation begins at thirty feet," Aris says. He doesn't turn around. "That's the threshold. After that, you're committed."

Jax's hand stops moving. "Committed how?"

"Your tissues absorb nitrogen. Ascend too fast, it comes out of solution. Bubbles in your blood, your joints, your brain." Aris's reflection meets mine in the glass. "Decompression sickness. The bends. Fatal if you're careless."

"We have protocols," Mara says. Her tone is flat, corrective. "No one ascends without clearance."

"How long?" I ask. My voice comes out steadier than I feel. "If something happened. If we needed to leave."

Mara looks at me for the first time since the hatch closed. Her expression is unreadable. "Minimum? Forty-eight hours in a decompression chamber. That's if everything works. If the chamber's intact. If we have power."

"And if not?"

"Then you wait longer. Or you don't."

The words land like stones. Jax pushes off the wall, flexes his hands open and closed. "Okay but like—people do this all the time, right? Divers, researchers, whatever. It's not actually—"

"It's exactly," Aris says. "You're choosing to place yourself in an environment where mistakes have no margin. Where rescue is measured in days, not hours."

MOTHER continues above us, pleasant and relentless. "Emergency oxygen reserves are located in panels marked with green luminescence. CO₂ scrubbers cycle every six hours. Do not tamper with—"

"Mara." I step closer to her, lower my voice. "Say it clearly. What's the part I need to manage?"

She meets my eyes. Doesn't blink. "The part where you don't get options."

My throat tightens. I swallow against it. "I need you to be more specific."

"You're asking me to give you the line that makes it sound acceptable." Mara's voice doesn't rise. "There isn't one. If this fails—the habitat, the systems, any critical component—we wait for surface support or we die. Those are the options. That's what you signed."

"I didn't sign anything that said—"

"You signed a waiver that said you understood the risks of saturation diving in a closed environment." She tilts her head toward the viewport. "This is what understanding looks like."

Jax makes a sound that might be a laugh. "Jesus Christ."

"Decompression protocols exist for a reason," Aris says. His hands rest behind his back, fingers laced. "They're not suggestions. They're physics."

The chamber shudders. Not violently—just enough to remind us we're moving. Descending. I press my palm against the wall and feel vibration travel up my arm, into my chest. The steel is cold. Condensation beads along the seam where wall meets ceiling, drips onto the floor in a rhythm that shouldn't be soothing but somehow is.

MOTHER's voice shifts register. "Descent commencing. Please secure personal items and remain—"

The sound comes from above us. A crack—sharp, clean, wrong. I look up and see it: a hairline fracture in the bulkhead seam, thin as spider silk. As I watch, it widens. Not fast. Just inevitable.

Mara moves first. "Aris—"

"I see it." His voice is level but his hands are already reaching for the tool kit velcroed to his belt. "Pressure differential. Inner seal's compromised."

Water seeps through the crack. Not a spray—a slow, deliberate intrusion. The drops hit the floor and spread, darker than they should be.

Jax backs toward the hatch we came through. "We need to—"

"We're past thirty feet." Aris doesn't look at him. He's staring at the bulkhead, at the fracture spreading like a decision being made. "We're committed."

The crack widens again. I hear the groan of metal under pressure, feel it in my teeth. Mara's hand moves to the emergency panel but she doesn't open it yet. She's calculating something I can't see.

I count my breaths. Two in, four out. My hands are ice.

The bulkhead buckles inward with a sound like thunder compressed into a single moment. Metal screams. Water doesn't spray—it punches through, a solid column that hits the opposite wall and shatters into chaos.

Mara's hand slams the emergency panel and a klaxon splits the air—three short bursts that mean something I haven't learned yet. Aris lunges toward the breach with a metal plate from his kit, but the water pressure pins it uselessly against the wall. Jax is screaming something about the hatch, about going back, but Mara grabs her shoulder and shoves him toward the viewport side of the chamber, away from the flood. Her mouth moves close to my ear: "The descent pod. Now."

Through the viewport I see it—a smaller cylinder attached to our chamber like a parasite, its hatch ringed in yellow. I didn't notice it before. Didn't think to ask. Mara's already moving, her fingers working a manual release I can't track, and the hatch grinds open with a hydraulic hiss that cuts through even the water's roar. She pushes Jax through first, then reaches back for me. "It only holds three," she says, and I understand before I can stop myself from understanding. Aris is still at the breach, bracing the plate with both hands, and he's not looking at us anymore.
