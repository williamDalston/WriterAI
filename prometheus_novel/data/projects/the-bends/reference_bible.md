# THE BENDS — Pipeline Reference Bible

## Purpose

This document is a persistent state reference for AI-generated novel production. Every generation pass should ingest this document in full before producing any chapter content. It contains: the story's premise, a character bible with speech patterns and physical vocabulary, a detailed setting map, a scene-by-scene outline with character locations, tense rules, a repetition blacklist, and unresolved thread tracking.

---

## 1. PREMISE

**Logline:** A crisis PR consultant trapped in a deep-sea habitat discovers she and the other occupants are unwitting subjects in a behavioral experiment funded by her client's sponsor — and must decide whether to expose the truth or protect herself.

**Genre:** Psychological thriller with survival horror elements.

**Core theme:** Performance vs. authenticity. Every major character is performing a version of themselves. The habitat strips those performances away. The central question is: what's left when the mask comes off?

**Secondary theme:** Complicity. Elena isn't innocent. She's built a career burying inconvenient truths for powerful people. The habitat forces her to confront whether she's a fixer or an accomplice.

**Setting period:** Near-future. Technology is slightly advanced (AI monitoring systems, deep-sea saturation habitats repurposed as luxury retreats) but grounded. No sci-fi elements. No supernatural elements. No body horror. Everything that happens has a rational, human explanation.

## 2. CHARACTER BIBLE

### Elena Vance (narrator, first person)

**Role:** Crisis PR consultant / "fixer." Hired to manage Jax Vale's public rehabilitation.

**Age:** Late 30s.

**Background:** Built a career reshaping narratives for celebrities and executives in crisis. Has buried inconvenient truths before — including maintenance logs related to a pressure vessel failure that killed three people. She told herself it wasn't her responsibility. That guilt is the engine of her arc.

**Personality:** Controlled, observant, strategic. Reads people like scouting reports. Defaults to manipulation as a survival mechanism. Emotionally guarded. Uses professionalism as armor.

**Arc:** Moves from controlling narratives to telling the truth. The climax is her recording a confession/testimony rather than spinning the story.

**Signature habit:** Adjusts/smooths her sleeves when stressed — a self-soothing gesture tied to her need for control. USE THIS NO MORE THAN 4 TIMES across the entire manuscript. It should appear in Chapter 1 (establishing), once in the middle act (under pressure), once near the climax (instinctive, then she stops herself), and in the final chapter (she reaches for her sleeves and stops — the habit breaking signals the arc completing).

**Speech pattern:** Precise. Short declarative sentences under pressure. Longer, more analytical internal monologue when she has time to think. Never uses filler words. Rarely asks questions she doesn't already know the answer to. When she does ask a genuine question, it signals vulnerability.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Elena):**
- Presses her temples when fighting a headache (CO2 exposure)
- Counts breaths deliberately (two in, four out) as a calming technique
- Hands go cold when she's afraid — she notices this about herself
- Stands with weight evenly distributed, shoulders squared — "professional posture" she can't turn off

**Elena DOES NOT:** Pick at cuticles (that's Jax), cross her arms (that's Mara), wipe her palms (that's Aris), drum her fingers (that's Linnea).

---

### Jax Vale

**Role:** Celebrity / influencer. Elena's client. The ostensible reason everyone is at the Aethelgard.

**Age:** Late 20s.

**Background:** Rose to fame as a lifestyle influencer. Got caught in a scandal involving faked charity work — took money earmarked for hunger relief. Silas Greer, his sponsor, arranged the Aethelgard stay as a "rehabilitation retreat" to rebuild his image. In reality, Jax is the bait that got everyone on board.

**Personality:** Approval-hungry. Performative by instinct — even his "authentic" moments are rehearsed. Fragile under pressure but has a stubborn core that emerges when the performances are stripped away. More perceptive than people give him credit for.

**Arc:** Moves from performing authenticity to actually being authentic. His arc mirrors Elena's but from the opposite direction — she's too controlled, he's too exposed.

**Speech pattern:** Informal. Sentence fragments. Uses "like" and filler words when nervous. Asks questions he's afraid to hear the answers to. Trails off mid-sentence. When he's being genuine (rare at first, more frequent later), his language gets simpler and more direct.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Jax):**
- Picks at his cuticles / scrapes his thumbnail against his index finger when anxious (his primary tell — equivalent of Elena's sleeve-adjusting)
- Flexes his hands open and closed when he doesn't know what to do with them
- Leans into surfaces — walls, glass, consoles — like he needs physical support
- His smile is described in terms of performance: "the one he wears for cameras," "trying on smiles," etc.

**Jax DOES NOT:** Adjust sleeves, press temples, stand with squared shoulders, speak in precise declarative sentences.

---

### Silas Greer

**Role:** Jax's sponsor. Funder of the Aethelgard project. The money behind Aris's experiment.

**Age:** 50s.

**Background:** Venture capital / private equity. Funds "experiences" and "transformative retreats" as branded content investments. The Aethelgard was his idea — pitched to Aris as a controlled environment to study human behavior under pressure, pitched to Jax as rehabilitation, pitched to the public as a luxury wellness retreat. Always has multiple agendas running simultaneously.

**Personality:** Performs generosity while calculating ROI. Never raises his voice. Controls rooms through positioning, not volume. Genuinely believes his manipulations serve a greater good — or at least tells himself that. His "sacrifice" at the bell is his final performance.

**Arc:** Revealed as the architect of the entire situation. His exit strategy (the secondary bell) proves he was never at risk. He remains unredeemed — the one character who never drops the mask.

**Speech pattern:** Longer sentences than anyone else. Rhetorical questions. Pivots conversations by reframing the question. Uses corporate/media language naturally: "optics," "narrative," "stakeholders." Pitches his voice to carry in group settings. When speaking privately, drops to a low, intimate register that's somehow more threatening.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Silas):**
- Straightens his cuffs — a power gesture, not a nervous one (contrast with Elena's sleeve-adjusting, which is self-soothing)
- Clasps hands behind his back — keynote speaker posture
- Adjusts his collar when caught off guard (rare)
- Moves through rooms "like he's closing a deal"

**Silas DOES NOT:** Pick at anything, show nervous tics, lean on surfaces, fidget.

---

### Captain Mara Sato

**Role:** Captain of the Aethelgard. Responsible for crew safety and facility operations.

**Age:** 40s.

**Background:** Former naval officer. Hired by Silas to run the habitat. Takes the job seriously. Follows protocol because protocol saves lives. Her conflict: she suspects something is wrong but her training tells her to follow the chain of command, and the chain of command leads to Silas.

**Personality:** Direct. No-nonsense. Uncomfortable with ambiguity. Breaks when reality doesn't comply with regulations. Has a protective instinct she buries under professionalism.

**Arc:** Moves from rigid protocol-following to independent action. Her decision to take the Section D bell and escape is morally ambiguous — she's saving herself, but she's also the one most likely to get help from the surface. Whether this is cowardice or pragmatism is left unresolved.

**Speech pattern:** Imperative sentences. Commands, not requests. Shortest dialogue of any character — rarely more than 5-8 words per line. Doesn't explain herself. When she does speak at length, it signals something is seriously wrong. Uses military/nautical terminology naturally.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Mara):**
- Crosses her arms — defensive/authority posture
- Scans spaces like she's marking exits
- Moves with deliberate efficiency — no wasted motion
- Grip strength — when she grabs someone, it leaves marks

**Mara DOES NOT:** Fidget, pick at anything, adjust clothing nervously, speak in long sentences.

---

### Dr. Aris Kade

**Role:** Chief systems engineer / scientist. Runs the Aethelgard's life support and environmental systems. Secretly running behavioral experiments on the crew at Silas's direction.

**Age:** 40s.

**Background:** Multiple advanced degrees. Brilliant, meticulous, ethically compromised. Believes his work has scientific value. The crew tech's death was the moment his experiment went wrong — the death was unintentional, and it's the crack in his armor. He's been covering it up since.

**Personality:** Clinical. Observational. Speaks in declarative statements rather than opinions. Treats human behavior as data. Has a quiet arrogance that manifests as patience — he waits for people to arrive at conclusions he reached hours ago. Underneath the clinical exterior, he's afraid of what he's done.

**Arc:** Exposed as the experimenter. His "observation" framework collapses when real people start dying. He doesn't get a redemption — he's complicit — but the narrative should register that he's disturbed by the tech's death, even if he won't admit it.

**Speech pattern:** Measured. Never raises his voice. Speaks slightly slower than everyone else. Makes statements rather than asking questions. Uses hedging language ("perhaps," "one might argue") when he's deflecting. When caught, goes monosyllabic. His most dangerous moments are when he's perfectly calm.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Aris):**
- Wipes his palms on his thighs — his primary nervous tell (he's aware of it and hates it)
- Fingers tap surfaces — console edges, bulkheads — like he's running calculations
- Tilts his head when observing someone — clinical assessment posture
- Goes very still when surprised or caught — freezes rather than fidgeting

**Aris DOES NOT:** Smile warmly, laugh genuinely, cross arms, pick at anything, adjust clothing.

---

### Linnea Shaw

**Role:** Architect / designer of the Aethelgard's interior spaces. On board as a consultant and because she understands the facility's physical layout better than anyone.

**Age:** Mid-30s.

**Background:** Designed the "luxury" elements of the habitat — the Velvet Lounge, the cabin layouts, the aesthetic overlay that makes a deep-sea industrial facility feel like a boutique hotel. Knows every structural weakness because she worked around them during design. This knowledge becomes critical in the escape.

**Personality:** Sharp, competitive, needs to be indispensable. Will undermine others to stay relevant. But genuinely brilliant about spatial design and structural engineering. Under extreme pressure, her competitiveness falls away and her expertise takes over.

**Arc:** Moves from self-serving to collaborative. She's the one who identifies the secondary bell as an escape route — her design knowledge saves lives.

**Speech pattern:** Quick, sometimes cutting. Finishes other people's sentences. Uses architectural/design metaphors. Her humor has edges. When serious, drops the wit entirely and becomes precise and technical.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Linnea):**
- Drums her fingers against surfaces — restless energy
- Moves "hips first" — confident physicality
- Traces edges of things — viewports, consoles, seams — designer's habit
- Wraps her arms around herself when afraid (contrast with her usual confident posture)

**Linnea DOES NOT:** Pick at cuticles, wipe palms, adjust sleeves, cross arms in authority posture.

---

### Priya Nand

**Role:** Ship's medical officer.

**Age:** 30s.

**Background:** Trauma medicine background. Competent, principled, increasingly horrified by what's happening. She's the moral compass — the character who consistently pushes for truth over strategy.

**Personality:** Calm under medical pressure, less calm under interpersonal pressure. Says what she means. Doesn't play political games. Her directness is both her strength and what makes her vulnerable in this environment.

**Arc:** Minor arc. She represents what Elena could be if Elena chose honesty over control. Her consistency is the point — she doesn't change because she doesn't need to.

**Speech pattern:** Clinical precision when discussing medical matters — uses proper terminology naturally. More emotional and direct in personal conversations. Asks pointed questions. Doesn't accept deflection. The only character who consistently calls Elena on her bullshit.

**Physical vocabulary (unique to Priya):**
- Hands move toward medical equipment instinctively — stethoscope, tablet, kit
- Checks vitals as a reflex — reaches for people's wrists
- Stands with spine straight, rigid posture when stressed
- Stares at her own palms when processing something disturbing

**Priya DOES NOT:** Adjust clothing, drum fingers, tilt her head clinically, move with casual confidence.

---

### MOTHER (AI system)

**Role:** The Aethelgard's integrated AI monitoring system. Manages environmental controls, security, communications, and — crucially — behavioral logging.

**Background:** Installed as a standard facility management AI. Aris reprogrammed it to log behavioral data: stress responses, group dynamics, authenticity metrics. It monitors everything and reports to Aris. It is not sentient, not malicious — it's a tool being used for an unethical purpose.

**Voice:** Flat, precise, slightly too intimate. Speaks in present tense. Uses clinical language for human behavior ("Authenticity detected," "Behavioral response logged," "Subject anxiety threshold exceeded"). Its neutrality is what makes it unsettling.

**Function in narrative:** MOTHER should appear in Chapters 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. It is the mechanism by which the reader understands the experiment is ongoing. Its statements should always be slightly "off" — just wrong enough to register as creepy without being overtly sinister. In Chapter 10, MOTHER is silenced mid-sentence when Aris's sabotage is exposed — symbolizing the experiment ending.

## 3. SETTING MAP

### The Surface Platform

A steel industrial platform anchored in the North Atlantic, sitting at sea level. This is the boarding point. Crew and visitors arrive by helicopter (40-minute ride from shore). The platform houses the transfer chamber that descends to the habitat below. It has: a helipad, a staging area, camera positions for media, and the transfer chamber airlock.

**Important:** The Aethelgard itself is NOT visible from the surface. It's hundreds of meters below. The platform is industrial and functional, not luxurious.

### The Transfer Chamber

A pressurized descent vehicle that carries personnel from the surface platform down to the habitat. The transition from surface to habitat happens here. The air changes, the pressure changes, and the sense of being trapped begins.

### The Aethelgard (underwater habitat)

The habitat is organized along a central corridor called **The Spine**. All major sections branch off from this corridor. The layout:

```
[Transfer Chamber / Airlock]
         |
    [The Spine Corridor] — main artery, curved, industrial
         |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+
    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
  Cabins  Velvet  Life   Med   Obs   Engineering
  (1-12)  Lounge  Supp.  Nook  Deck  / Ballast
                   Bay
         |
    [Bell Dock - Main]
         |
    [Section D - Secondary Bell] (sealed, "compromised")
```

**The Spine Corridor:** Industrial. Curved walls, metal grating floor, cabin doors stamped with corroding numbers. Condensation on every surface. Emergency lighting is amber. The corridor narrows slightly toward the lower decks, increasing claustrophobia.

**Cabins (1-12):** Small. Cot, locker, wall screen (most don't work). Low ceilings. Condensation drips from the same spots. Elena is in cabin 12. Jax is nearby but the exact number is never specified.

**The Velvet Lounge:** Linnea's showcase — the luxury overlay on the industrial skeleton. Mirrored mosaic tiles, velvet panels, curved booths, amber lighting, a bar. MOTHER's main holographic interface is here. Designed to make people feel like they're in a boutique hotel, not an underwater bunker. As the story progresses, the luxury degrades: mahogany warps, chrome rusts, condensation fogs the mirrors.

**Life Support Bay:** Industrial. Oxygen tanks along one wall, environmental control panels, CO2 scrubbers. This is Aris's domain. The circuit board tampering happens here.

**Med Nook:** Small medical station. Exam table, supply cabinet, monitoring terminal. Where the second body is found.

**Observation Deck:** Tiny room with a thick acrylic viewport looking out into the ocean. Bioluminescence visible outside. The only place where the beauty of the deep ocean is visible. Used for the Elena/Jax emotional scenes.

**Engineering / Ballast Deck:** Lowest level. Coldest. Smells like rust and seawater. Linnea's structural console is here. Where the hull stress is most audible. Where the evacuation decision happens.

**Bell Dock (Main):** The primary emergency exit. A diving bell cradle with manual and automated controls. Capacity: 4-5 people.

**Section D / Secondary Bell:** A sealed section designated "structurally compromised." In reality, the bell chamber itself is functional — independent pressure system, designed as a redundancy. Silas had the codes written into his contract. This is his exit strategy. Mara ultimately uses it.

### The Rescue Vessel (Chapter 12 only)

A surface ship. Medical bay, decompression chambers, corridors with salt-streaked windows. Industrial but warm after the Aethelgard. The first clean air.

---

## 4. TENSE RULES

**Primary tense: PRESENT.** All main narrative is written in present tense. Elena narrates as events happen.

> "I stand at the console. The readout flickers. Aris watches me from across the room."

**Flashbacks and retrospective passages: PAST.** Clearly marked by a scene break (---) and/or an opening line that establishes the shift.

> "The helicopter ride from the dock had taken forty minutes."

**Rule:** A scene break (---) is the ONLY place where tense is permitted to change. Within a continuous scene, tense must remain consistent. If the narrative is in present tense, it stays in present tense until a scene break.

**Rule:** After a scene break that uses past tense, the NEXT scene break must explicitly return to present tense in its opening line.

---

### Chapter 10: Revelation

**Scene 1 — Confronting Aris (present tense)**

- Characters present: Elena, Aris, then Mara
- Elena demands answers. Aris drops the pretense: "You're not a victim, Elena — you're a subject. Every variable controlled. Every response logged."
- MOTHER begins to speak — is cut off mid-sentence by a system override. The experiment's monitoring is being shut down.
- Mara arrives. Elena tells her: "He sabotaged it."
- Aris deflects to Silas: "He signs the checks."
- Aris walks away. Mara and Elena work together to repair the relay.

**Scene 2 — The Evacuation Decision (present tense)**
- Location: Engineering / Ballast Deck
- Characters present: Elena, Jax, Mara, Linnea, Silas, Priya. (Aris absent.)
- Hull is failing. Linnea identifies the structural collapse.
- Linnea reveals the secondary bell in Section D — her architectural knowledge.
- Plan: split into two groups. Mara takes one group to main bell. Elena takes others to Section D.
- Silas volunteers to stay and trigger the emergency buoy. His "sacrifice" seems too rehearsed.
- Mara assigns groups and leaves with Linnea, Priya, and Jax toward main dock.
- Elena discovers Silas already knew about the secondary bell. The buoy deploys automatically — his sacrifice was theater.
- Elena finds Mara's vest at the Section D bell chamber. Mara took the secondary bell alone. Message on the comm to Silas: "I'm coming." His reply: "See you topside."
- KEY BEAT: Mara and Silas both had exit strategies. Elena and the others were expendable.
- CLIFFHANGER: 32 minutes of oxygen left. Main bell untouched. Section D bell gone.

**CRITICAL CHARACTER TRACKING:**
- After the split: Mara went to Section D (not main dock as announced), took the bell, ascending alone.
- Silas went toward Section D corridor but his exact movements are ambiguous.
- Jax, Linnea, Priya were directed toward main dock by Mara — but Mara never went with them.
- Elena is at Section D, alone, discovering the betrayal.
- Aris is unaccounted for — last seen leaving the Life Support Bay.

---

### Chapter 11: The Bell

**Scene 1 — The Main Bell Dock (present tense)**
- Location: Main bell dock
- Characters present: Elena, Jax, Aris (appears), then the group boarding
- Elena reaches the main dock. Jax, Linnea, and Priya are there — they realized Mara never showed and came here on their own.
- Aris appears. Elena confronts him: "You weren't trying to fix anything. You were studying us."
- Elena names the full conspiracy aloud: Silas funded it, Aris ran it, Jax's rehabilitation was the cover, MOTHER logged everything.
- Aris: "You're smarter than your file suggested."
- Elena's sleeve-adjust #4 (instinctive, then she stops herself — the habit beginning to break).
- They board the main bell. The question of weight/capacity: the math is tight but workable.
- Jax offers to stay. Elena refuses.

**Scene 2 — Ascent (present tense)**
- Location: Inside the main diving bell, ascending
- Characters present: Elena, Jax, Linnea, Priya, Aris. (Silas and Mara are gone.)
- The bell ascends. Bioluminescence outside. A moment of terrible beauty.
- Elena tells the others about the backup being offline.
- A second vessel rises from below — a MAINTENANCE SUBMERSIBLE stored at the facility's external dock, part of the original construction equipment. Silas knew about it because he funded the build.
- Someone inside presses their face to the porthole. It's Silas. He was never going to sacrifice himself. He had his own exit.
- Elena's realization: "His noble sacrifice. Performance, all of it. The same kind I used to sell."
- The thought: "How perfectly I would have done the same thing, once."
- CHAPTER ENDS with both vessels ascending. No resolution yet — just the terrible clarity of seeing the performance for what it was.

**CRITICAL CHARACTER TRACKING:**
- Main bell: Elena, Jax, Linnea, Priya, Aris (5 people, tight fit)
- Maintenance submersible: Silas (alone — accessed from the external dock while everyone focused on the bells)
- Section D bell: Already taken by Mara (ascended earlier, already at surface)

### Chapter 12: Surface

**Scene 1 — Decompression (present tense)**
- Location: Rescue vessel medical bay
- Characters present: Elena, Jax, Mara (already aboard from earlier ascent), Priya, medics
- First clean air. Decompression begins.
- Mara is already there — she arrived first in the Section D bell. She's exhausted but functional.
- Jax is catatonic — staring at his hands, two-word answers.
- Priya treats Elena. IV. Monitors.
- Mara tries to manage the narrative: "When Jax's family arrives at port—"
- Elena says "No." The old reflex kicks in and she rejects it.
- KEY BEAT: Elena internally names the full conspiracy — Silas funded, Aris experimented, MOTHER logged, the tech's death was the margin of error.

**Scene 2 — The Window / The Confession (present tense)**
- Location: Rescue vessel corridor
- Characters present: Elena, then Mara (brief)
- Elena alone at a window. Her reflection. The ocean.
- Mara finds her. Brief exchange about choices, sides, truth.
- "You always knew I'd have to stop performing." "Yeah."
- Mara leaves.
- Elena pulls out her phone. Opens the voice recorder.
- Records her testimony: names Silas, Aris, the experiment, the tech's death, her own complicity.
- The habit breaks — she reaches for her sleeves and stops. The arc completes.
- CHAPTER ENDS with Elena speaking into the recorder. The ocean outside. The red light blinking. Silence is what killed people down there. She's done being silent.

**Character locations at end:** Elena on rescue vessel. Jax in medical. Mara aboard. Silas ascending separately. Aris in custody or under watch. Linnea and Priya in decompression.

## 7. UNRESOLVED THREAD TRACKING

Threads that must be explicitly resolved or intentionally left ambiguous (with a note explaining why).

### Must Resolve

| Thread | Introduced | Must Resolve By | Status |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Who killed the crew tech? | Ch 5 | Ch 10 (Revelation) | Aris's experiment miscalibrated — unintentional death |
| Who killed the second crew member? | Ch 8 | Ch 10–11 | Aris covering tracks after tech death — or separate actor (DECIDE) |
| Who was breathing in Elena's doorway (Ch 2)? | Ch 2 | Ch 3 or Ch 5 | Aris conducting night observation rounds |
| What was Jax trying to tell Elena on the dock (Ch 1)? | Ch 1 | Ch 9 (Confession Walk) | He'd been tracking oxygen drops — wanted to warn her |
| Why was Elena specifically selected? | Implied | Ch 10 | Aris/Silas chose her because her fixer skills make her a valuable behavioral subject — she'll try to manage the crisis rather than panic |
| Who stole Mara's override key? | Ch 9 | Ch 10 | Aris (or someone acting on his behalf) |
| How did Silas know about the maintenance submersible? | Ch 11 | Ch 11 (in-scene) | He funded the build — had construction manifests |
| Mara + Silas collusion ("I'm coming" / "See you topside") | Ch 10 | Ch 12 | Mara's pragmatism meets Silas's planning — she took the deal when survival math demanded it |

### Intentionally Ambiguous

| Thread | Reason for Ambiguity |
|--------|---------------------|
| Is Mara's escape cowardice or pragmatism? | Thematic — the reader decides. Elena doesn't judge her in the narration. |
| Does Elena's confession actually reach anyone? | Standalone: yes, implied. Series: the counter-narrative launches. |
| What happens to Aris legally? | Elena names him in the recording. Consequences are implied, not shown. |
| Did MOTHER develop any autonomous behavior? | No — but the question lingers. MOTHER is a tool, but its "too intimate" voice leaves doubt. |

### Continuity Flags (things that must remain consistent)

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| Bell capacity | Main bell: 4-5 people. No more. |
| Override key holders | 5 people: Elena, Mara, Aris, one senior crew, Jax (revoked). Silas has separate codes. |
| Elena's cabin number | 12. Always 12. |
| Habitat depth | ~600 ft / ~180m. Consistent. |
| Time since tether snap | Must be trackable chapter to chapter. Use scene headers or internal references. |
| Who has been where | Track per chapter in outline above. Characters cannot appear in locations without transit. |

## 8. POV AND KNOWLEDGE RULES

**Narrator:** Elena Vance, first person.

**Elena can perceive:**
- What she sees, hears, smells, touches, tastes in her immediate environment
- Her own thoughts, feelings, physical sensations
- Other characters' visible expressions, body language, and audible speech
- Reasonable inferences based on her professional skill (reading people)

**Elena CANNOT perceive:**
- Other characters' internal thoughts or feelings (she can guess, but must frame it as inference: "his face does something I can't read" not "he feels conflicted")
- Events happening in rooms she isn't in
- Information she hasn't been told or discovered
- System data she hasn't accessed on a screen or terminal

**Rule:** If Elena describes another character's emotional state, it must be filtered through observation: "I see it in her face before she says anything" or "his posture tells me he's afraid." Never: "fear grips him" or "she feels conflicted."

## 11. TRUTH FILE (author-only reference)

### What Actually Happened

Silas Greer conceived the Aethelgard as a dual-purpose venture: a luxury rehabilitation brand AND a controlled behavioral research environment. He pitched the research angle to Dr. Aris Kade, who designed the monitoring protocols and reprogrammed MOTHER to log behavioral data. The "rehab retreat" was the public face. The experiment was the real product.

### Who Did What

- **Silas:** Funded everything. Designed the business model. Ensured he had personal exit strategies (maintenance submersible, Section D codes). Recruited Aris. Selected subjects — including Elena — based on psychological profiles that would produce the most valuable behavioral data.
- **Aris:** Designed and ran the experiments. Reprogrammed MOTHER. Conducted the "trials" — environmental stressors calibrated to measure panic responses, group dynamics, trust erosion. The venting test, the atmospheric adjustments, the door lockdowns — all his.
- **Mara:** Initially unaware. Discovered the experiment mid-crisis. Made a pragmatic survival calculation — took Silas's deal (Section D bell access) in exchange for not exposing him immediately. Her "I'm coming" message is her choosing survival over solidarity.
- **MOTHER:** A tool. Not sentient. Logging data as programmed. Its "too intimate" voice is a design choice by Aris — intended to create psychological dissonance.

### What They Expected

A controlled 30-day study with measurable stress responses. No deaths. The tether snap was REAL and UNPLANNED — a genuine seismic event that turned a calibrated experiment into an actual survival crisis. Everything that happened after the tether snap was Aris trying to maintain control of an experiment that had already escaped his parameters.

### What Went Wrong

The crew tech died during an environmental calibration that Aris ran AFTER the tether snap, when the habitat's systems were already stressed beyond design limits. Aris miscalculated the margins. The death was unintentional — but Aris covered it up rather than admitting the experiment existed. The second death was a consequence of the cover-up: the crew member discovered evidence of Aris's tampering and confronted him. The exact mechanism is deliberately ambiguous (could be another miscalculated test, could be deliberate silencing, could be an accident during a confrontation). Aris arranged the body to look peaceful — a gesture of guilt, not care.

### Elena's Unforgivable Sin

Before the Aethelgard, Elena buried maintenance logs related to a pressure vessel failure at a client's facility. Three workers died. She had the evidence that the inspections were falsified. She chose her career over their lives. She told herself it wasn't her direct responsibility. It was. The Aethelgard forces her to relive that choice — this time, she chooses differently.
