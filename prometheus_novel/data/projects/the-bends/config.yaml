# === STORY CORE ===
synopsis: >
  Elena Vance is the woman brands call when an influencer becomes radioactive.
  She cleans reputations for a living, turning scandals into arcs, pain into content,
  and apologies into revenue. Her newest job is the biggest of her career: shepherding
  Jax Vale, a once-beloved creator whose "charity" was exposed as a grift, through a
  public redemption spectacle on the Aethelgard, the world's first luxury deep-sea
  saturation habitat. Thirty days underwater. No phone. No exits. A live-scheduled
  "detox" marketed as authenticity.

  Two days in, a seismic event snaps the habitat's tether and knocks them down the
  continental shelf. The broadcast dies. The surface goes silent. The Aethelgard
  becomes a sealed museum of expensive breath. Oxygen scrubbing degrades. CO₂ rises.
  The walls begin to talk in tiny metallic pops. In the dark, everyone reverts to
  their oldest survival habits: bargaining, performing, blaming.

  When Elena discovers the backup oxygen system was manually disabled before the quake,
  she understands the terror has intent. Someone wanted them trapped. Someone wanted
  the masks to crack. As paranoia blooms and bodies start appearing in places that
  should be impossible, Elena must do the one thing her entire career avoided:
  tell the truth about what she helped bury. The only way out is not a confession
  for the audience. There is no audience. It's confession for the living.

premise: "A crisis PR fixer and her disgraced influencer client are trapped in a failing luxury underwater habitat with a saboteur. Survival requires stripping away the curated self."
protagonist: "Elena Vance, 34, crisis PR manager. Hyper-competent, emotionally avoidant, addicted to control. Flaw: she confuses optics with morality."
protagonist_expertise: ["persuasion", "narrative control", "reading people", "media handling", "asking the right questions"]
protagonist_limits: ["forensic analysis", "engineering", "life support diagnostics", "circuit board inspection"]
antagonist: "Dr. Aris Kade (hidden saboteur) + the ocean/pressure/time (external)."
central_conflict: "Elena must identify the saboteur and keep the group alive while the habitat's systems fail and old secrets turn lethal."
central_question: "Who are you when nobody is watching, and the only currency left is breath?"
setting: "The Aethelgard: an Art Deco luxury saturation habitat 600 ft underwater in the North Atlantic. Condensation, groaning metal, amber emergency lights."
world_rules: "Hard physics only: saturation diving constraints, limited oxygen/CO₂ scrubbing, decompression realities, no fast escape, failing power, sealed compartments."

# === CONTENT ELEMENTS ===
themes: "performative identity vs authentic survival; commodified trauma; complicity; redemption without applause; the cost of control"
tone: "claustrophobic, noir-leaning, visceral, dread-forward, emotionally sharp"
writing_style: "close first-person present (Elena), high sensory specificity, short punchy interior lines under stress"
influences: "technical suspense + psychological acuity; luxury-satire energy turning into survival horror"
subplots: "B-plot: Elena's buried role in a prior cover-up resurfaces. C-plot: a staged romance becomes real grief. D-plot: the habitat AI becomes a confessional mirror."
key_plot_points: |
  ACT 1: The tether snaps; broadcast dies; group realizes they're truly alone.
  ACT 2 (Midpoint): Elena finds the backup oxygen was disabled by hand; it's a cage, not an accident.
  ACT 3: The hull begins to fail; escape requires a brutal choice about who fits in the bell and what truth goes up.
motifs: "mirrors/reflections; breath/CO₂ headache; crushing pressure; red recording light; bioluminescent flickers in darkness"
other_characters: "Jax Vale (disgraced influencer), Captain Mara Sato (habitat commander), Linnea Shaw (architect), Priya Nand (med tech), Silas Greer (billionaire sponsor), 'MOTHER' (habitat AI/house system)"
avoid: "supernatural monsters; deus-ex-rescue; villain monologues; dream-sequence reveals; cheap shock twists"

# === OPTIONAL: Strategic Guidance ===
strategic_guidance:
  pacing_notes: "Act 1 seduction (luxury, roles). Act 2 compression (systems fail, secrets leak). Act 3 velocity (choices, sacrifice, truth). Keep chapters short and oxygen-tight."
  aesthetic_guide: "Deep teal + amber emergency light + rust + condensation + velvet luxury decaying into utility steel."
  dialogue_bank: "Influencers default to therapy-speak and brand language. Crew speak in procedure and blunt constraints. Elena translates everything into leverage until it stops working."
  tropes: "locked-room whodunit; survival countdown; parasite fame nightmare; 'the fixer must be fixed'"
  stakes_ladder: "social death -> professional death -> literal death -> moral rebirth"
