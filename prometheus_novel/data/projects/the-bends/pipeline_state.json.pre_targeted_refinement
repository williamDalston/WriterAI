      "content": "Jax's smile was too wide, teeth gleaming like pearls against ash-grey stubble, and I knew before he opened his mouth that I'd made a mistake coming here.\n\nThe ocean air tasted like metal and money as I stepped onto the dock. The Aethelgard glowed just offshore like an underwater Taj Mahal, all chrome and glass beneath the morning sun's hesitant rays. Jax was already there with Silas Greer, his sponsor, both of them posing for cameras in a carefully curated tableau of sincerity and luxury.\n\nJax looked up as I approached, his smile too wide, teeth gleaming like pearls against ash-grey stubble. He waved me over, the movement sharp and calculated. Behind him, Silas watched with an almost predatory intensity, scanning my approach like he was looking for a chink in armor, a crack to exploit.\n\n\"Elena,\" Jax said as I came within earshot. \"You're finally here.\" My voice carried just enough of his old charm to mask the desperation beneath it.\n\n\"She's here now,\" Silas chimed in smoothly beside him, one hand resting casually on Jax's shoulder. The gesture seemed more possessive than supportive. \"Let's get this show rolling.\"\n\nI cut a glance at Silas before turning my attention back to Jax. \"Show?\"\n\nJax's eyes flickered with panic before he schooled his expression. \"The broadcast. Starts in twenty minutes.\" He peered at Silas, a silent plea I recognized\u2014the same one he'd made to producers, directors, anyone who could save him from himself.\n\n\"Your contract specifies full media access,\" Silas said, her gaze locked on mine. \"I assume you've prepared accordingly.\"\n\nMy feet stayed planted on the dock. Let Jax drown in his own spectacle, let Silas find another therapist willing to perform. But that would mean admitting I couldn't control this. I straightened my spine, shoulders back. \"I'm here to reset Jax's narrative. Not to be part of yours.\"\n\nSilas's smile sharpened. \"Of course. Healing. Clarity.\" He squeezed Jax's shoulder once before releasing him. \"All very noble.\"\n\nJax's expression wavered between relief and something darker. He stepped toward me, close enough that the cameras couldn't catch his words. \"Elena, there's so much I need to tell you about what happened\u2014\"\n\n\"You're here because you need structure. Not absolution.\"\n\nThe hurt that flashed across his face was genuine, and for an instant the old instinct kicked in\u2014to soften, to reassure. I held my ground.\n\n\"Right,\" Jax said through his teeth. He turned toward the Aethelgard, jaw tight.\n\nSilas watched us both, his interest almost clinical. Waiting for me to bend. To prove I was just another variable he could manage.\n\n\"Let's board.\" I gestured toward the gangplank with more force than necessary. \"We're on a schedule.\"\n\nJax and Silas fell into step beside me without speaking. The deck was bustling\u2014crew members moving under Captain Mara Sato's direction, their efficiency a stark contrast to our strained silence.\n\nHalfway across, I caught sight of Dr. Aris Kade near the command center. My eyes were already on me, not with curiosity but recognition. Like he'd been expecting me. Like he knew exactly who I was before I'd ever stepped aboard.\n\n\"Who's he?\" Jax asked quietly, following the direction of my gaze without needing to be told.\n\n\"Aris Kade. He keeps the systems running.\"\n\nSilas snorted beside us but didn't comment further as we boarded the Aethelgard and made our way down towards the living quarters below deck. The air inside was already warmer, heavy with a faint scent of metal and ozone from the oxygen scrubbers cycling through to keep everyone breathing comfortably.\n\nI navigated Jax and Silas into their respective spaces\u2014keeping them apart as much as possible for now. But I couldn't shake the feeling that Aris Kade had known me before this moment. My gaze had followed me like he was reading something in my movements, a silent question hanging between us even from across rooms.\n\nI squared my shoulders and pivoted towards Jax's room to prep him for our first broadcast of the day. The ocean air outside still tasted metallic but inside, it had already feel more oppressive than liberating.",

I let my fingers hover over the airlock panel, counting the seconds it takes for the indicator light to flick from red to amber. My hands are steady, but the air inside the chamber is too still, too thick. It smells like stale leather and something metallic\u2014not rust, sharper than that. Machine oil mixed with something organic. I lift my foot and let it drop again. The deck gives slightly under my heel, warped metal that shouldn't flex like this.\n\n\"Elena,\" Mara says. \"You're in the transfer chamber. That's where we start.\"\n\n\"You think\u2014\" Jax Vale's hands grip the bulkhead. \"This isn't some wild experiment. It's a real timeline.\"\n\nI nod, but I don't look at her. My eyes are on the bulkhead. It's cracked at the base, a hairline fracture that shouldn't be there. \"We start where?\"\n\n\"Where we always start.\" She shifts her weight. \"Here. With the rules.\"\n\nThe speaker clicks on. A monotone voice, genderless, says, \"Welcome to the Aethelgard. All personnel are subject to saturation rules. No decompression within twenty meters of the hull. No surface exit until full recompression. Any deviation is a critical breach.\"\n\nDr. Aris Kade's voice overlaps the recording. \"This procedure is not optional. Thresholds are not negotiable.\" My fingers tap the console, metal vibrating under his touch.\n\nI hold my breath. I've heard that before\u2014briefing videos, training manuals. But now it's here, in front of me, pressing into my lungs.\n\n\"You're not going to like this,\" Mara says.\n\nI turn toward her. She's standing with her hands on her hips, posture rigid. Her face is unreadable, but I know the look. It's the one she wears when she's ready to pull the plug on someone's nonsense.\n\n\"Don't say that,\" I snap. \"I've managed worse than this. I've listened to worse.\" My hands clench at my sides.\n\n\"I don't like anything. But I listen.\"\n\nShe exhales sharply. \"We don't get to choose.\"\n\nMy pulse hammers in my ears.\n\n\"You're not\u2014\" Mara's jaw tightens. \"And I'm not the one who's going to let you break it.\" Her eyes lock onto mine.\n\nI take a slow step forward. The sound echoes in the confined space, louder than I expect. Then the deck shudders beneath my boots\u2014a deep vibration that travels up through my legs and into my chest. The hairline fracture in the bulkhead splits wider, a finger-width gap now, and something dark seeps through it. Not water. Not oil.\n\nThe overhead lights flicker once, then die, leaving only the amber glow of the airlock panel. In the sudden shadows, I hear it: a wet, rhythmic sound from the other side of the bulkhead. Like breathing.",

      "content": "The Velvet Lounge. MOTHER's voice slides through the speakers before I even see the room: \"Welcome home, Jax Vale.\" The words land wrong\u2014too intimate, like she's been waiting. Like she knows something I don't.\n\nI push through the threshold and the Velvet Lounge opens like a mouth. Amber lights pulse against glass walls. Outside, water laps at the hull in rhythms too regular to be natural. My reflection fractures across mirrored mosaic tiles\u2014shoulders narrower than they should be, cheeks hollow, skin stretched over bone like it's trying to escape.\n\nJax grins\u2014my grin, the one I wear for cameras. Wide eyes. Spin slow. Take it all in. \"This is insane.\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" Linnea's voice behind me, thick with satisfaction. She moves past, hips first, heading for MOTHER's console. Mara trails after, eyes already cataloging violations, lips moving around words she hasn't spoken yet.\n\nI hang back. Watch.\n\nJax leans into a velvet panel, fingers finding the seam where mirrors meet. \"Do I look different?\" My voice barely carries. He's asking his reflection, not us.\n\n\"Of course you do.\" Linnea taps the screen beside MOTHER's hologram. The projection shivers. \"You're here now.\"\n\nMara won't touch anything. She stands three feet from the nearest surface, tablet pressed to her ribs like a shield. The rules say no contamination of sanitized spaces. But that's not what I see in her posture. She's afraid of something else. Something the rules don't cover.\n\nMy job: keep Jax dazzled. Keep the sponsor's investment secure. I step forward, let the weight settle across my shoulders.\n\n\"Jax, the sponsor wants a walkthrough. First impressions. For the documentary.\"\n\nHe turns. That look\u2014eager, unguarded. \"Right now?\"\n\n\"While it's fresh.\" I gesture toward the curved booth in the corner. Camera lens glinting. \"Just sit. Talk.\"\n\nLinnea's hand on my arm, nails digging through fabric. \"I should prep him first. Messaging matters. The sponsor expects a specific tone.\"\n\n\"He doesn't need a script.\" Mara moves between us, tablet raised. \"Authenticity metrics are flagged as priority. Coaching corrupts the data.\"\n\n\"Metrics?\" Linnea's laugh has edges. \"This isn't a spreadsheet, Mara. It's about making people feel something.\"\n\nJax's smile cracks. My eyes bounce between them. He's drowning. I could pull him out\u2014shield him from the machinery we've built around his body. But I need him compliant more than comfortable. The contradiction lodges in my throat. I swallow it.\n\n\"Both of you, stop.\" My voice lands flat. Final. \"Jax goes in alone. Five minutes. No coaching.\"\n\nMara's knuckles go white against the tablet. \"The protocol specifically states that first impressions require\u2014\"\n\n\"I know what it says.\" I hold her eyes. She looks away first. Small victory. Tastes like ash.\n\nLinnea tilts her head. Studies me. \"You're taking a risk, Elena. What if he says something off-narrative? The sponsor won't forgive that.\"\n\n\"Then we'll know what we're working with.\" I turn to Jax. Let my face soften\u2014not much, just enough. \"You've got this. Talk about what you see.\"\n\nHe nods. My fingers twist together. I file that away.\n\nAs he walks toward the booth, Linnea leans in. Her perfume is too sweet, chemical under the floral notes. \"You're gambling with the sponsor's money.\"\n\n\"I'm investing it.\" My hands are cold. I shove them in my pockets.\n\nJax settles into the booth. MOTHER coos encouragement through the speakers. The camera light blinks red. On the monitors, I watch him try on smiles\u2014testing, adjusting, finding the one that fits. He's performing even when he thinks he's being real.\n\nLinnea drifts to the bar. Pours amber liquid into crystal, slow and deliberate. Mara hovers near the door, tablet clutched to her chest. I stand in the middle, calculating angles.\n\nLinnea: needs to be indispensable. Will undermine to stay relevant.\n\nJax: approval-hungry. Malleable. Fragile under pressure.\n\nMara: rules as religion. Breaks when reality doesn't comply.\n\nI pull out my notebook. Write it down. Each observation is a tool. Each weakness is leverage.\n\nBut something's wrong. It starts small\u2014the way MOTHER's responses land half a second too late, like she's translating from another language. The way Linnea keeps glancing at the door. The way the amber lights pulse just slightly out of sync with the water against the hull.\n\nThis was supposed to be sanctuary. Controlled environment for Jax's transformation. Instead it feels like a trap designed by someone who understands exactly how to make comfort suffocate.\n\nOn the monitor, Jax leans toward the camera. My voice drops. I can't hear the words, but I see my eyes glisten. He's giving them something unscripted. Something I didn't authorize.\n\nMy pen stops.\n\nThe control I thought I had\u2014it was always smoke. Jax isn't the only one being recorded. I look up. The nearest camera isn't pointed at the booth. It's pointed at me.\n\nMOTHER's voice drifts through the speakers: \"Authenticity detected. Flagging for sponsor review.\"\n\nLinnea's glass freezes halfway to her mouth. Mara's fingers go rigid on her tablet. The plan just shifted. I'm not managing Jax's narrative anymore. I'm managing my own.\n\nI close the notebook. Walk toward the booth. Each step a choice I can't unmake.",

      "content": "I wake to metal groaning somewhere in the walls. The sound drags me up from sleep\u2014not sudden, just persistent enough that my brain won't let go of it. I sit up. The amber emergency lights make everything look like it's underwater even though we already are.\n\nThe Spine Corridor's walls are slick. I put my palm against the metal and it comes away wet. The cold goes straight through my shirt, into my ribs. I walk toward the center of the habitat where the sound came from, but by the time I get there it's gone.\n\nThe mechanical hums are louder at night. Or maybe I just notice them more when there's nothing else to focus on. The air smells like ozone and something else\u2014something organic that the filters can't quite scrub out. Each breath coats my throat.\n\nWater beads on every surface. The floor has small pools in the low spots where the habitat settled unevenly. My boots leave prints in the condensation. I watch them fade behind me, one after another, like I was never there.\n\nThis place was designed for people who wanted to feel like they were escaping. Now it just feels like a cage that cost too much.\n\nI reach Jax's cabin. The door's open. He's sitting on his cot with his elbows on my knees, staring at the wall.\n\n\"Can't sleep?\" I lean against the doorframe.\n\n\"Could ask you the same thing.\" He wipes his palm down the wall, then looks at the water on my hand. Flicks it onto the floor. \"You doing okay down here, Vance?\"\n\n\"Just checking the corridor.\"\n\n\"At 0300?\"\n\nI shrug. The metal doorframe digs into my shoulder blade. \"Heard something.\"\n\nHe's quiet for a moment. \"This place gets in your head if you let it.\"\n\nI nod. We don't need to say more than that. I push off the doorframe and keep walking.\n\nThe Spine Corridor curves. The lights flicker\u2014just once, barely noticeable\u2014but my pulse kicks up anyway. I count the cabin doors as I pass them. Eight. Nine. Ten. Mine's at twelve. The numbers are stamped into the metal, already corroding at the edges from the salt air.\n\nWhen I get back to my cabin, I don't turn on the interior light. The amber glow from the corridor is enough. I can see the cot, the locker, the wall screen that hasn't worked since day two. The ceiling is low enough that if I stood on the cot I could touch it.\n\nI lie down. Stare up. Water droplets form in the same spots every time, following the microscopic imperfections in the metal. They grow until they can't hold anymore, then roll sideways toward the seam where the ceiling meets the wall. I watch three of them make the journey.\n\nThe air tastes like I'm breathing through a filter that needs changing. Metallic. Stale. I pull it in through my nose, push it out through my mouth. Two counts in. Four counts out. It's the only thing I can control down here.\n\nThe mechanical hums shift in pitch. Something in the life support system cycling through its routine. Or maybe the hull adjusting to the pressure. I don't know enough about the engineering to tell the difference, and that's the problem. Every sound could be normal or it could be the thing that kills us, and I have no way to know which.\n\nI close my eyes. Keep counting. Two, four. Two, four. My heartbeat slows to match it.\n\nThen the lights go out.\n\nNot the flicker from before. Complete darkness. The amber emergency strips die all at once, and the mechanical hums cut off mid-cycle.\n\nI'm on my feet before I can think. My hand finds the wall in the black. The metal is still wet, still cold, but now there's something else\u2014a vibration I can feel through my palm. Rhythmic. Deliberate.\n\nFrom somewhere in the corridor, I hear footsteps. Too heavy to be Jax. Moving toward my open door.",

Someone was testing us, and the lights had just gone out to prove it.\n\nMy hands went to my temples before I even registered the pain\u2014a stuttering, jagged pulse that made my teeth ache. I'd been in too many places where systems failed. This one felt different. Worse. The scent of ozone was thick, like a wound in the air. I turned to the wall. The panel that should have been broadcasting the outside world was dead. No feed, no signal, no flicker of life. Just a void.\n\n\"Jax.\"\n\nI leaned against the far wall, arms crossed, the same smirk I'd seen on him the day the press caught him mid-lie. \"Guess it's just us now, huh?\"\n\n\"Guess.\" I didn't look at him. I reached for my sleeve and smoothed it down. Controlled.\n\n\"Did you do this?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Me? No, I like the lights. I prefer them on.\"\n\nI spun to the panel, fingers hovering. The screen was blank. Not broken, not just off\u2014gone. My breath came faster, shallow. The pulse of adrenaline. The body's way of saying, *this is not a simulation*.\n\n\"Elena.\"\n\nI turned. Dr. Aris Kade. My eyes sharp, my voice even. He was never louder than necessary. He looked at me like I was the one who had made a mistake.\n\n\"Procedure,\" he said. \"We need to confirm isolation. You know the protocol.\"\n\nI did. I'd written it. I'd trained others to follow it. But the moment this room had gone dark\u2014this wasn't a standard failure. It was too clean, too deliberate.\n\n\"I'll check the system logs.\"\n\nKade didn't move. \"You're not going to like what you find.\"\n\nI didn't answer. I walked past him, toward the panel. My hands were steady, but inside, I was counting. *One, two, three*\u2014I had to stay in control.\n\n\"Where's Mara?\"\n\nKade's eyes flicked to the door. \"She's on the other end of the corridor. Monitoring the main hatch.\"\n\n\"Monitoring?\" I stopped walking. \"What's she looking for?\"\n\n\"Any sign of breach. Or escape.\"\n\n\"Escape?\"\n\nI didn't look at me. \"You know what this is, Elena. This isn't just a malfunction.\"\n\nI did know. I'd known since the first time I buried an accident. But I was not going to let that knowledge define me now.\n\nI turned back to the panel, fingers on the interface. I pressed a command. The screen flickered. Data. Glitches. Something was interfering.\n\n\"Jax,\" I said. \"You ever hear of a system failure that only affects one room?\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\nI peered at him. \"You're not saying anything.\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"You always know what's coming. I just wait for you to figure it out.\"\n\nI turned away from him. The waiting for truth to surface had worn thin.\n\n\"Kade. How long before the backup systems kick in?\"\n\nI didn't answer right away.\n\n\"Ten minutes. Maybe less.\"\n\nI inhaled sharply. Ten minutes. Just enough time for someone to start believing they were trapped. Just enough time for panic to take hold. I had to stop that. I had to stop it before it even began.\n\nI turned back to the panel.\n\n\"Jax. Listen to me. This isn't just a failure. Someone's testing us.\"\n\nShe looked at me. Her eyes wide. \"What are you\u2014\"\n\n\"Someone's testing us,\" I said again. \"And I have a feeling they know exactly what they're doing.\"",

My breath came in short, precise bursts. I reached for the panel, fingers brushing the surface, and the light went out. A hiss of air, then silence. The kind that came after a door closed, or a lie settled in its place.\n\nI leaned in, eyes scanning the interface. The screen was dark. No data, no diagnostics. No countdown. No signal. Just void. The others were out there, somewhere in this vessel, but I was alone now, and I needed to know what was happening before I had to face them.\n\nI turned, my back to the wall, and pressed my palm flat against the metal. My fingers curled, nails digging into the surface. The cold seeped through my gloves. I had been taught long ago that the best way to deal with fear was to let it take you, and then take control. I wasn't sure if that still worked. Control was already slipping through my fingers.\n\nThe door behind me hissed open. I didn't turn. I didn't move. I just waited.\n\n\"You're not alone in this, Elena.\" Jax Vale's voice, my hand gripping the doorframe.\n\n\"Elena.\"\n\nThe voice was calm, measured. Not angry, not surprised. Just present. I turned slowly, my gazes snaggeding on the figure standing in the doorway. Aris Kade. His hands were clasped behind my back, his posture relaxed, but my gaze was sharp. I had seen him do this before, standing in the center of chaos, as if it were a performance he was meant to be in.\n\n\"I assume you're not here to ask how I'm\u2014\"\n\n\"You're not doing well.\"\n\nI exhaled, hard. \"You assume a lot.\"\n\nI stepped forward, his boots against the floor. \"I assume you know why I'm here.\"\n\nI did. I knew exactly why he was here. I had been watching him, waiting for the moment to make his move. I had seen it in my eyes, in the way he had positioned himself in the corridors, in the corners of the ship where no one else would be. He wanted me to know I was being watched. He wanted me to feel it. And now, he was here, standing in front of me like it was a game.\n\n\"I don't like being played, Aris.\"\n\nMy eyes didn't flicker. \"You're not being played. You're being warned.\"\n\n\"You're not the only one with a timeline.\" Dr. Kade's voice was calm, but my fingers twitched at his sides, the faintest tremor betraying his tension.\n\nI took a step forward. \"Then warn me properly.\"\n\nShe glared at me for a moment, then spun toward the console. My hand hovered over the panel, and my pulse throbbed in my throat. She would do it. She would show me.\n\nHe pressed my fingers against the surface. The screen flickered. Then, slowly, it came to life.\n\nA timer. Red. Counting down from 10 minutes.\n\nMy breath caught. My head snapped toward him.\n\nI didn't blink.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"What it looks like.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer.\"\n\nHe tilted her head slightly. \"It's the only answer you're getting right now.\"\n\nI stared at the screen. The numbers ticked down. 9:47. 9:46. 9:45.\n\nMy hand shot out and grabbed my wrist. \"What happens when it reaches zero?\"\n\nAris pulled free, backing toward the door. \"You already know.\"\n\nThe timer dropped to 9:32. Behind me, somewhere deep in the ship's hull, metal groaned. Not the settling kind. The breaking kind. I looked at the console, then at the empty doorway where Aris had been standing three seconds ago. He was already gone. And I was still here, watching the numbers fall, with no idea which system was about to fail first.",

That was all it took for the walls to start their slow press inward.\n\nDr. Kade stood near the central console, hands folded behind my back. He looked at me like I was a data point that didn't fit the curve. The lights flickered when the system hummed. My stomach clenched.\n\n\"You're wasting time,\" I said. \"The oxygen levels are stable.\"\n\nHe tilted her head. \"For now.\"\n\nI stepped closer, close enough to see the way my jaw stayed loose when he lied. \"You said the broadcast was a test. What's the real one?\"\n\nI reached into his tool kit and pulled out a small device\u2014looked like a remote, but the buttons were labeled with chemical symbols. He held it up, turning it slowly. \"CO\u2082 levels are rising faster than the scrubbers can compensate. The real clock isn't on the wall. It's in your lungs.\"\n\nMy throat went tight. I'd spent years learning how to manage systems, how to read indicators before they broke. \"You're lying.\"\n\nMy eyes didn't move. \"The air you're breathing now is already thinner than it should be. That's not a mistake. That's a calculation.\"\n\nI took a step back. The wall pressed cold metal against my spine. The room felt smaller, like the ceiling had dropped six inches while I wasn't looking. He was watching me. Not as a scientist. As a warden. That look\u2014the one that said I'd given him the power to use it.\n\n\"You think I don't know the math?\" My voice came out low. \"I've done these calculations. I've read the reports. You're not the only one with access to the numbers.\"\n\n\"I'm the one showing you the truth.\"\n\nA soft chime came from the console. I turned toward it, but he was already moving. His hands moved fast, precise, like he was conducting something I couldn't hear. The lights flickered again. The air felt heavier\u2014not water, but wet concrete settling over my chest.\n\n\"Stop,\" I said. \"You don't get to\u2014\"\n\n\"\u2014Control the variables?\" He finished for me, his tone flat. \"You think you're in control, Elena. But you're just waiting for the moment it all comes apart.\"\n\nThe chime spun into a steady beeping. I stared down at my hands. My nails had left crescents in my palms. I'd been careful. I'd been precise. I'd made sure every system functioned exactly as it was designed to. But now I was here, in a room with a man who believed I'd failed. Who believed I'd failed on purpose. I wasn't going to stop until he broke me. The strength to keep pretending I hadn't already cracked\u2014I wasn't sure I had it left.",

The air smells wrong\u2014sweat cutting through the vanilla diffuser scent, salt from someone's tears mixing with whatever chemical they use to keep the upholstery from molding. Jax's breath keeps hitching. He tries to speak and my voice splits down the middle. \"We need a plan, Elena.\"\n\nI nod. My pulse hammers at the base of my skull.\n\nSilas Greer moves forward with his hands clasped behind my back like he's about to deliver a keynote. \"We should make a public statement.\" Her eyes find mine, waiting for me to agree. \"Something for the surface audience.\"\n\n\"There's no audience, Silas.\"\n\nHe keeps talking over the murmurs rising around us, my voice hitting that practiced cadence he uses for camera work. \"We need something concrete for the surface. To prove we're\u2014\"\n\n\"Silas.\" Captain Mara Sato cuts him off. \"There is no one out there listening.\"\n\nShe stares at him like she's daring him to argue with physics. Linnea Shaw's gaze bounces between us. Priya Nand stands by the medical supplies, jaw locked, fists tight against her sides. Dr. Aris Kade watches from the corner with that expression he gets\u2014the one that makes me think of insects pinned to boards.\n\nJax's voice cracks the silence. \"Elena, why didn't you tell me?\" His hands shake. \"Why did we need this place if it was just going to\u2014\"\n\n\"There was a backup.\" The words come out flat.\n\n\"Was?\" Silas turns on me. My voice drops. \"You didn't think it might have been compromised? That someone made sure we'd all die down here?\"\n\nMara goes rigid beside him.\n\nLinnea's voice comes out steadier than I expect. \"What are you\u2014\"\n\n\"Someone wanted us trapped here.\" Silas looks at each of us in turn. His mouth curves but there's nothing warm in it. \"And I think we need to find out who.\"\n\nThe room holds its breath.\n\nAris's lips pull into something adjacent to a smile. My eyes don't blink. \"Interesting theory.\" The words land like ice water.\n\nThe air gets heavier. Accusations start flying\u2014half-formed, ugly, desperate. Mara's fists clench tighter. Priya steps forward. \"We need facts. Not speculation.\"\n\nLinnea looks at me, then at Aris, then back. Her face does something complicated.\n\n\"Elena.\" Jax's voice breaks. \"Why did you bring me here?\"\n\nI try to hold the room together but it's like grabbing smoke. \"This was meant to save your career.\"\n\n\"But at what cost?\"\n\nHe won't look at me anymore. They turn away\u2014most of them. Huddle together in clusters, voices dropping to whispers that hiss against the walls. Trust shatters with each exhale. Aris is still watching me. His mouth moves like he's saying something but I can't hear it over the blood pounding in my ears. He nods once, sharp, then walks toward the corridor that leads deeper into the habitat.\n\nI'm surrounded by people and completely alone.\n\nThe door seals behind him with a hydraulic hiss that makes my teeth ache. I'm about to follow when my tablet vibrates against my hip\u2014three short pulses. The emergency frequency. I pull it out with numb fingers.\n\nThe message is two words: AIRLOCK BREACH.\n\nThen the lights cut out.",

Fingers curled like he'd tried to grab hold of air itself, tried to pull himself away from whatever killed him. My eyes were open, pupils blown so wide the irises had nearly disappeared. Terror, not pain. The kind of look that said he'd seen it coming and couldn't stop it.\n\nThe smell hit me as I stepped closer. Not blood\u2014something sharper. Burnt plastic mixed with ozone, the kind of tang that comes from electrical systems dying badly. It thickened near the oxygen tanks where he'd fallen, coating the back of my throat through the mask.\n\n\"Door's locked from the outside.\" Priya's voice stayed flat, procedural. No fear in it yet.\n\nI pushed anyway, shoulder into the seal. The door clicked open.\n\nWrong. That was wrong.\n\nI caught Priya's sleeve before she could step through. Held up one finger to Mara. Wait.\n\n\"Check.\" Priya's breath fogged between us as we moved inside, boots sliding on tiles slick with condensation. \"No one should\u2014\"\n\nShe stopped. The body lay crumpled against the oxygen tanks, dark hair plastered to his skull. Eyes open. Hand clutching at nothing, fingers still curled around air. Steam vented from somewhere above, pulsing in and out like the room itself was breathing. I scanned the walls. Tools mounted in their brackets. Emergency supplies untouched. Everything exactly where it should be except for him.\n\n\"Read?\" I kept my eyes on the body, looking for what didn't fit.\n\nPriya knelt, checked for a pulse we both knew wouldn't be there. \"Cardiac arrest. No visible trauma.\"\n\n\"You hear anything before this?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Locked sections,\" Mara said from the doorway, not quite entering. \"No access without command override.\"\n\nI stepped back, gave them room. If there was something to see up close, I needed them focused on it, not on me hovering.\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"Crew tech.\" Priya didn't look up. \"Dane something. Third shift.\"\n\nThe silence stretched. Mara's eyes moved from the body to the door seal to me.\n\n\"This isn't equipment failure,\" she said.\n\n\"Could be anyone,\" I said, but the words came out hollow. Jax's face surfaced in my mind\u2014sealed sections and who had access to override codes.\n\n\"It's not anyone.\" Mara's voice went hard. \"It's someone who knows how to manipulate life support without triggering alarms.\"\n\nPriya shifted beside me, hands moving toward the nearest console.\n\n\"Check the systems,\" Mara said. \"Everything that touches this section.\"\n\nPriya nodded once, spun. Her fingers flew across the interface before I could add anything.\n\n\"He's dead,\" I said, mostly to myself. \"We need a headcount. Everyone.\"\n\n\"I'll round them up.\" Mara moved toward the door. \"Keep them in common areas.\"\n\n\"Priya\u2014\"\n\nShe pulled up diagnostics, not waiting for me to finish. The screen lit her face in blue-white, shadows pooling under her eyes.\n\n\"We keep this contained,\" Mara said from the doorway. \"No one wanders. No one goes anywhere alone.\"\n\nI dipped his chin. Giving up control, but we needed order more than we needed my ego intact.\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nMara disappeared around the corner. No goodbye, no reassurance. Just gone.\n\nI turned back to Priya. She stood rigid at the console, spine straight, fingers moving across keys like she was trying to outpace something.\n\n\"Start with environmental controls,\" I said. \"Anything that's been accessed in the last six hours.\"\n\nThe screen flickered. Once, twice. Then alarms started\u2014soft chiming that built into a cascade of red warnings. Breach indicators. System failures. Pressure anomalies in sections that should have been stable.\n\nPriya's hands stopped. She looked at me over her shoulder, and it in her face before she said anything. This wasn't isolated. This wasn't one dead tech in a locked room.\n\n\"Multiple breaches,\" she said. \"Someone's been in the system for hours.\"\n\nI moved closer, read the timestamps over her shoulder. Access logs showing overrides in sections we'd cleared, doors we'd sealed. Someone had been moving through the station like a ghost, touching systems we relied on, leaving everything just functional enough that we wouldn't notice until\u2014\n\nUntil now.\n\n\"Pull the access codes,\" I said. \"Find out who.\"\n\nPriya's fingers moved again, pulling up authentication logs. The screen scrolled through entries, dozens of them, all showing the same thing.\n\nCommand override. No user ID.\n\n\"They're using a master key,\" Priya said. \"Could be anyone with admin access.\"\n\nI stared at the screen, at the pattern of intrusions spreading through the station's systems like rot. Doors unlocked and relocked. Environmental controls adjusted by fractions. Life support tweaked just enough to stress the margins without triggering failsafes.\n\nSomeone was testing us. Seeing how far they could push before we broke.\n\n\"How many people have command access?\" I asked.\n\n\"Five. You, Mara, Chen, Okafor, and\u2014\"\n\nShe stopped.\n\n\"And who?\"\n\nPriya's jaw tightened. \"Jax had it. Before.\"\n\nBefore he became whatever he was now. Before the systems started failing and people started dying and everything went to hell in increments too small to see until you stepped back and looked at the whole picture.\n\nI pulled out my comm, keyed Mara's channel. Static answered, then her voice cutting through.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"We've got a problem. Someone's using command codes to access sealed sections. Environmental, life support, door controls\u2014everything.\"\n\nSilence on the other end. Then: \"How long?\"\n\n\"Hours. Maybe longer.\"\n\n\"Fuck.\" Mara's voice went quiet, the kind of quiet that meant she was thinking through scenarios, running probabilities. \"Can you lock them out?\"\n\nI peered at Priya. She shook her head.\n\n\"Not without shutting down the whole system,\" Priya said. \"And if we do that\u2014\"\n\n\"We lose environmental control,\" I finished. \"We'd have maybe an hour before things get critical.\"\n\n\"So we're trapped,\" Mara said. \"With someone who knows exactly how to kill us without leaving fingerprints.\"\n\nI looked at the body again, at Dane-something with my hand still reaching for nothing. Cardiac arrest, Priya had said. No trauma. But my eyes were wide, pupils blown, face locked in something that looked more like terror than pain.\n\n\"Get everyone together,\" I said into the comm. \"Common area. Now. No exceptions.\"\n\n\"Already on it.\" Mara cut the channel.\n\nI turned back to Priya. She stared at the screen, at the cascade of warnings still scrolling past.\n\n\"Can you trace where the overrides are coming from?\"\n\n\"Maybe. If they're still active.\" Her hands moved again, pulling up network maps, tracing signal paths through the station's infrastructure. \"There. Someone's accessing the system from.. maintenance junction twelve.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"Two decks down. Near the water intake.\"\n\nNear the flooded sections. Near where we'd lost contact with half the crew. Near where Jax had last been seen before everything went dark.\n\nI grabbed my comm again. \"Mara. I need you to\u2014\"\n\nStatic. Then nothing.\n\nI tried again. Dead air.\n\n\"Priya, check communications.\"\n\nHer fingers flew. The screen shifted to show the comm network, and I saw it\u2014another override, cutting channels one by one, isolating us into smaller and smaller groups.\n\n\"They're shutting us down,\" Priya said. Her voice stayed level, but her hands were shaking now. \"Whoever this is, they're cutting us off from each other.\"\n\nI looked at the door, at the corridor beyond. Dark except for emergency lighting, red glow painting everything the color of warning.\n\n\"We need to move,\" I said. \"Now.\"",

Numbers that don't hold still.\n\nI try to remember the last time I told the truth when it mattered. Can't pin it down. The air tastes like I'm sucking on a battery. I breathe through my mouth and it doesn't help.\n\nThe technician's face keeps surfacing. Eyes open. Pupils blown wide. The way my cheek pressed flat against the grating, skin going waxy under the LEDs. Nobody trips and dies that clean.\n\nI pull the file on Jax closer. Physical printouts\u2014I don't trust the servers anymore. Every page is a version of events I polished until they reflected what people needed to see. What got buried stays buried. Except now we're all buried, and the rules might be different down here.\n\nA knock.

The crew's asking questions I can't\u2014\"\n\n\"Tell them we're investigating.\"\n\n\"That's not what I asked.\" She moves closer. The skin around her mouth looks thin, stretched. \"What aren't you telling me?\"\n\nI reach for the maintenance logbook. Physical copy, because I made them keep physical copies. Dates. Times. Names. I flip through entries until I hit two days ago\u2014the day the tether snapped and we started our drift into the trench.\n\nDr. Aris Kade logged a routine check on the environmental controls. Seventeen minutes. Signed off clean.\n\nAris moves like he's conducting surgery on everything he touches. If he wanted to bury something, he'd bury it deep. But why? The man's got three PhDs and a reputation that got him hired for this. What does he gain by killing us all?\n\nI flip back. Forward. Back again. The pages make a sound like shuffling cards.\n\nMy adrenaline hit in my throat. I swallow and it doesn't go away.\n\nThis stopped being about reputation the moment we lost surface contact. But if I tell the whole truth\u2014if I lay out what I did to Jax, what I know about the systems, who had access when\u2014I'm done. And if I'm done, who manages the fallout? Who keeps the crew from tearing each other apart?\n\nI close the logbook. Set it down next to my hip.\n\nIf I dig deeper and find nothing, I've wasted time we don't have. If I dig deeper and find something, I might make it worse. But keeping quiet while people die\u2014\n\n\"Priya,\" I say. \"I need you to trust me on this. Just a little longer.\"\n\nShe crosses her arms. \"That's what you said about the Jax situation. Right before everything went to hell.\"\n\nI stand up too fast. The chair scrapes. My lower back spasms\u2014I've been sitting hunched for hours.\n\nGuilt sits in my chest like a stone. Control sits right next to it, same weight, same shape. I can't tell them apart anymore.\n\nOne option: investigate quiet. Gather proof. Don't say anything until I know what I'm accusing and who I'm burning. Then say it and let the pieces fall.\n\nThe other option doesn't exist.\n\nI step past Priya into the corridor. Emergency lighting throws my shadow long and doubled against the curve of the wall. Somewhere three sections over, machinery hums\u2014recyclers, pumps, the things that keep us breathing.\n\nThe environmental control room is two corridors away. I'm halfway there when the lights cut out.\n\nTotal dark. The kind that makes you forget which way is up.\n\nThen the emergency strips flicker on\u2014red this time, not white. And through the wall I hear it: the high whine of a pressure seal failing. Section C. Where the sleeping quarters are.\n\nWhere most of the crew is right now.",

Behind me, Aris Kade's fingers stop moving across the console. The emergency lighting throws rust-colored shadows across the corridor walls as I moved toward Life Support moments ago. My uniform stuck to my back. The ventilation system was cycling too slow\u2014I could taste recycled air on my tongue, metallic and stale. The bay door hissed open. Inside, oxygen tanks line the far wall, their regulators clicking in sequence. Aris Kade had my back to me, fingers moving across a console panel. He didn't turn when I entered. \"You're back,\" he said. \"Equipment check.\"\n\nHe tapped something on the screen. \"Everything's within parameters.\"\n\nI crossed to the wall panel where they found the technician. The access plate hung crooked, four screws sitting in a neat line on the deck below it. Too neat. I crouched down, ran my thumb over the screw heads. No stripped edges. No corrosion. Someone removed these with time to spare. \"You should look at the diagnostic logs,\" Aris said behind me. \"More useful than\u2014\"\n\n\"I need full access to this bay.\" I picked up one of the screws, held it to the light. Clean threads. \"No restrictions.\"\n\n\"That's not protocol.\"\n\n\"Protocol didn't keep Reeves alive.\"\n\nSilence. Then the soft tap of his fingers resuming on the console. I pocketed the screw and moved to the tool locker. The seal's broken, hanging by one corner. The metal around the lock shows scratches\u2014fresh ones, silver against the oxidized gray. I pulled out my multi-tool, wedged it into the gap, and pried the locker open. Standard equipment inside. Wrench set. Diagnostic scanner. Plasma cutter\u2014\n\nThe plasma cutter's charge indicator reads sixty percent. It should be full. These get stored at full charge, always. I lift it out, check the nozzle. Residue around the tip, dark and crusted. \"What are you\u2014\" Aris starts. \"When was this last used?\"\n\nHe crosses the bay, looks over my shoulder. \"Logged maintenance was three days ago. Ventilation duct repair on Deck Four.\"\n\n\"This was fired more recently than that.\"\n\n\"You can't know that from\u2014\"\n\n\"The residue's still tacky.\" I scrape a flake off with my thumbnail. \"And someone used it down here.\"\n\nAris takes a step back. My jaw works like he's chewing something bitter. \"You're seeing patterns that aren't there.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" I set the cutter down, turn to face him. \"Four screws removed with care. A plasma cutter used off-log. A seal broken from the inside.\" I pull the screw from my pocket, hold it between us. \"Someone had time. Someone had access. Someone knew exactly what they were doing.\"\n\nHe looks at the screw, then at me. \"And you think that proves\u2014\"\n\n\"I think it proves someone's been in here doing work they didn't want recorded.\" I drop the screw back in my pocket. \"I think it proves Reeves wasn't the first person to notice.\"\n\n\"That's a hell of a leap.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\nWe stand there, three meters apart, the oxygen regulators ticking between us. Aris's hands are loose at his sides but his shoulders are tight. He's calculating something. \"Even if you're right,\" he says finally, \"what do you expect to find? A signed confession?\"\n\n\"I expect to find what was tampered with. Then I work backwards.\"\n\n\"And if that leads somewhere you don't want to go?\"\n\nI move past him to the main environmental control panel. The casing shows tool marks along the edge\u2014shallow gouges where someone forced it open without the proper key. I run my finger along the deepest one. \"Then I go there anyway.\"\n\nAris watches me work the panel open. Inside, the circuit boards are standard layout\u2014oxygen mix regulators, CO2 scrubbers, pressure controls. But one board sits slightly askew, its connector not quite flush. I lean closer. The locking tabs are bent. \"Someone pulled this,\" I say. \"Recently.\"\n\n\"Or it worked loose from\u2014\"\n\n\"These don't work loose.\" I press the board back into place until it clicks. \"They lock. That's the point.\"\n\nHe doesn't answer. I glance back at him. My face is carefully neutral, but my eyes track every movement I make. I pull the board back out, angle it toward the light. The contact points show wear, but there's something else\u2014a faint residue on the edge, almost invisible. I touch it. Slightly oily. Not machine oil. Something synthetic. \"What's the crew using for hand protection during maintenance?\" I ask. \"Standard nitrile gloves.\"\n\n\"Not latex?\"\n\n\"No. Latex degrades in the environmental mix down here.\"\n\nI hold up the board. \"Then why is there latex residue on this?\"\n\nAris goes very still. \"That could be from\u2014\"\n\n\"From what? A visitor?\" I set the board on the console between us. \"Someone brought their own gloves. Someone who doesn't work regular maintenance.\"\n\n\"You're building a case out of\u2014\"\n\n\"Out of evidence.\" I meet my eyes. \"Which is more than you're giving me.\"\n\nHe breaks eye contact first, looks down at the board. When he speaks again, my voice is quieter. \"What do you want me to say?\"\n\n\"I want you to tell me who else has been in this bay.\"\n\n\"I don't track every\u2014\"\n\n\"You track everything. That's your job.\" I step closer. For a moment I think he'll actually show me. Then he drops her hand. \"I can't help you,\" he says. \"Can't or won't?\"\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\nI pick up the circuit board again, turn it over in my hands. The residue catches the light, a faint smear across the connector pins. Someone touched this without proper gear. Someone who didn't care about leaving traces, or didn't know to care. \"It matters,\" I say, \"when the next person dies.\"\n\nAris's throat works. He looks at the board, at me, at the open panel behind us. \"You don't know what you're asking.\"\n\n\"I'm asking you to do your job.\"\n\n\"My job\u2014\" He stops. Starts again. \"My job is to keep this facility running.\"\n\n\"Your job is to keep people alive.\"\n\n\"Sometimes those aren't the same thing.\"\n\nThe words hang between us. I slide the circuit board into my pocket next to the screw, feel their weight against my hip. Two pieces of a puzzle I don't have the edges for yet. \"Then I'll do it myself,\" I say. I move toward the door. Behind me, Aris doesn't move, doesn't speak. The oxygen regulators tick their steady rhythm. The emergency lights paint everything the color of old blood. At the threshold I stop, look back. I'm still standing by the console, one hand resting on its surface like he's steadying himself. \"When this comes out,\" I say, \"remember I gave you the chance.\"\n\nMy jaw tightens. \"When this comes out, we'll all wish it hadn't.\"\n\nI leave him there, the bay door hissing shut behind me. The corridor stretches ahead, emergency lights flickering in sequence. My pocket feels heavier than it should. Two small pieces of metal and plastic, carrying the weight of questions I'm not sure I want answered. But I'll answer them anyway. That's the job.",

Condensation runs down the walls in uneven tracks, pooling where the metal seams don't quite meet. The overhead light flickers every few seconds, throwing his shadow across the floor in jagged pieces.\n\n\"I don't know how to be anyone when there's no audience.\" He turns, finally, and my face is all wrong\u2014too young, too raw. \"What do I do now?\"\n\nMy throat closes up. I could tell him the truth. I could say: *I built a career on scripted apologies and manufactured sincerity, and I don't know who I am either.* But his fear is a live wire, and I'm already holding too many.\n\n\"Be yourself.\" The words come out quieter than I meant. \"Just.. be who you are.\"\n\nHe laughs, sharp and bitter. \"Who am I when there's no performance? When all of this disappears?\"\n\nI press my palm against the wall. The metal bites cold through my skin, grounding me. \"You're still here. That counts.\"\n\n\"I think you're scared too.\" My voice cracks on the last word.\n\nThe observation deck shrinks around us. I can hear the ventilation system cycling, a low wheeze like the station itself is struggling to breathe.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I am.\"\n\nHe waits. The silence stretches, and I watch condensation bead on the window, racing down in crooked lines.\n\n\"But we don't have to let it win,\" I add.\n\n\"What now?\" Jax asks. Quieter this time. Like he's afraid of the answer.\n\nI pull in a breath. The air tastes like metal and recycled sweat. \"We find a way out.\"\n\n\"Or we make one.\"\n\nHis hands ball into fists. The knuckles go pale. When he looks at me again, something's shifted\u2014less performance, more bone-deep stubbornness. \"Together.\"\n\nThe word barely leaves my mouth before the lights cut out completely. Not a flicker this time\u2014just gone. The ventilation system dies mid-wheeze, and in the sudden silence I hear it: footsteps in the corridor. Multiple sets. Moving fast.\n\nJax grabs her wrist. My fingers dig in hard enough to bruise. \"Did you lock the door?\"\n\nI didn't.",

I twist enough to map the space\u2014long bay, narrow, pipes running floor to ceiling like exposed ribs. The backup oxygen valve sits behind a yellow tag on the far wall. MANUAL LOCKOUT: DO NOT OVERRIDE.\n\n\"The atmosphere's dropping.\"\n\n\"You're making it worse.\" Her fingers dig into my wrist. I yank back but she doesn't let go. I've seen Mara angry before\u2014this is something else. Something with edges.\n\n\"Someone's sabotaging the ship.\"\n\nShe makes a sound between a laugh and a cough. \"You always had an angle. Every single time.\" Her grip tightens until my hand goes numb.\n\n\"This isn't\u2014Jax is up there. Everyone else\u2014\"\n\n\"You think I don't know what you did?\" The words come out sharp enough to cut. \"Helped him fake charity work. Took money while people went hungry.\"\n\nThe yellow tag has a thumbprint on it. Fresh. Someone touched this recently.\n\n\"Listen to me\u2014\"\n\nShe shoves me backward. My shoulder blade hits the cabinet edge and pain shoots down my arm. I slide down, land hard on my tailbone in a puddle of something cold. Condensation, maybe. Or leaked coolant.\n\n\"I'm trying to keep us alive.\"\n\nHer eyes narrow. She looks at the valve, then back at me. Takes a step forward, hand reaching for the yellow tag\u2014then jerks back like she touched a hot wire.\n\n\"You can't open it,\" I say.\n\n\"Watch me.\"\n\n\"No\u2014I mean you can't. Not without\u2014\" I push myself up, feet slipping in the puddle. \"Let me do it.\"\n\nShe stares at the valve for three seconds. Four. Her hands curl into fists.\n\n\"Fine.\" She moves back. Not far. Just enough. \"But if this is another one of your\u2014\"\n\nI'm already moving past her, reaching for the tag. My hand shakes. The mechanism is simple\u2014press down, turn left. But someone disabled this before we ever set foot in this bay. Someone wanted us choking.\n\n\"I need something to pry with.\"\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\n\"Mara.\"\n\nShe walks to a cabinet at the far end. Comes back with a fire extinguisher instead of a crowbar.\n\n\"Use this.\"\n\nI take it. The metal is cold enough to sting my palm. I press down on the tag\u2014it clicks\u2014and twist left. The valve releases with a hiss that sounds like the ship exhaling.\n\n\"We need to tell the others.\"\n\nShe's already beside me, hand on my arm, pulling me into an embrace I wasn't expecting. Her chin digs into my shoulder.\n\n\"We're not getting out.\" Her breath is hot against my neck. \"Not like this.\"\n\n\"Then we tell them anyway. We fight.\"\n\nShe pulls back. Searches my face for something I don't think I have.\n\n\"I don't know if there's anything left to fight for.\"\n\n\"Mara\u2014\"\n\n\"Fix it.\" She turns toward the door that leads deeper into the bay. Stops. Looks back. \"Then maybe we figure out the rest.\"\n\nShe disappears into the dark before I can answer. The valve hisses beside me. I work the controls, fingers moving through the sequence I've drilled a hundred times. But there were no simulations for this\u2014for traps set with fingerprints still fresh on the tags.

The optics alone\u2014\"\n\n\"That's\u2014\" I start, but he's already moving, working the room like he's closing a deal.\n\nHeads turn. Nods ripple through the crowd. I watch the idea take root, spreading faster than I can cut it down.\n\n\"Elena's right.\" Jax's voice cracks on the second word. \"Something's wrong here. This doesn't\u2014\"\n\n\"Why else would we be down here?\" A woman near the velvet booths points at me, her finger shaking. \"You set this up!\"\n\n\"What do you even get out of this?\" Another voice, higher, threading toward hysteria.\n\nI open my mouth. Nothing comes out that doesn't sound like a politician dodging a question. The words die somewhere between my brain and my tongue.\n\nSilas takes a step closer. That grin hasn't moved. \"Maybe Elena didn't pull the plug herself. But means and motive? She's got both.\"\n\nHeat flares behind my ribs. I want to grab him by his perfectly pressed collar and\u2014\n\n\"Stop.\" Jax's hand lands on my forearm. His palm is damp. \"She didn't.\"\n\nSilas pivots toward him. \"Or maybe she gave everyone exactly what they wanted. A spectacle. Content. Isn't that the whole game?\"\n\nJax's fingers tighten. He looks at me \u2014 my eyes doing that thing where they're asking a question he can't say out loud.\n\n\"No,\" he says. Quieter this time. \"Not Elena.\"\n\nI hold my gaze. Try to pour everything I can't afford to say into the silence between us. He nods once. Lets go. Steps back into the crowd like he's wading into cold water.\n\n\"If she didn't do it,\" someone hisses from the back, \"why won't she tell us what she's covering up?\"\n\nI'm too tired to shout. Too tired to keep playing defense when the prosecution has already won the jury.\n\n\"Fine.\" My voice comes out flat. \"Let's check the systems.\"\n\nThey stare at me like I just confessed.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Silas waves toward the door. \"Go ahead.\"\n\nI push past him. My shoulder clips his. The corridor outside is all steel and condensation \u2014 water beading on pipes overhead, dripping onto the grated floor. My her breath came faster in my wrists. The backup system room hums. Not the clean hum of new machinery \u2014 this is older, grinding, like something's working too hard to keep up. Emergency lights blink across a wall of panels and exposed wiring. The manual override switch sits in its metal housing, red knob against black casing. I grip it. Twist. The click echoes louder than it should.\n\nSilence drops over the room like a held breath.\n\n\"Someone unplugged it.\" I force myself to turn around. They're crowding the doorway now, faces layered in shadow and amber light. \"But who?\"\n\nAccusation. Suspicion. Fear. Every face a different arrangement of the same three ingredients.\n\nJax pushes through. My hand finds mine again. My fingers are cold.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he says. Not to them. To me. \"None of us do.\"\n\nI squeeze back. My pulse ticks against my palm.\n\nThe room stays quiet. Heavy. Like we're all underwater and someone's about to run out of air first.\n\nThen the lights go out.\n\nNot the emergency lights \u2014 those stay amber and weak. The panel lights. Every indicator that was blinking green or red just.. dies. The hum grinds lower, deeper, like something's choking.\n\n\"What did you do?\" Silas's voice cuts through the dark.\n\nI didn't touch anything else. My hand is still on Jax's. The override switch sits where I left it.\n\nSomeone screams. Not loud \u2014 strangled, cut off fast. From somewhere in the corridor behind us.\n\nJax's grip tightens until my bones ache. \"Elena,\" he whispers. \"That wasn't the backup system.\"",

I mean\u2014crew member. Unnamed.\"\n\nThe body lies on the exam table, arms arranged too neatly at its sides. Someone positioned her that way. The Med Nook smells like antiseptic and something underneath it\u2014copper, maybe fear.\n\n\"You were talking to someone.\"\n\n\"I wasn't.\" Priya's fingers grip the edge of the counter. \"Mara. We need to move her to the main bay. Full autopsy.\"\n\nCaptain Mara Sato fills the doorway before I can respond. Her gaze moves from me to Priya to the body in one sweep.\n\n\"You need rest,\" Mara says. \"Your symptoms\u2014\"\n\n\"This person was in a sealed compartment,\" I cut in. \"During the blackout. When nothing was supposed to open.\"\n\nPriya's knuckles go white on the counter edge.\n\n\"Impossible,\" Mara says. \"The blackout locked everything down.\"\n\n\"The logs are corrupted. Twenty-minute gap around the time she died.\"\n\nPriya exhales through her teeth. \"it too.\"\n\n\"Then pull them up again,\" I say.\n\n\"Can't.\" Priya won't look at me. \"System's offline in here.\"\n\n\"You mean you won't.\"\n\nShe flinches. Mara moves into the room, positioning herself between us like she's separating fighters in a ring.\n\n\"We move her now,\" Mara says. \"Then we talk.\"\n\nThey work in silence, lifting the body onto a transport gurney. Priya's hands shake as she secures the straps. When they finish, Mara wheels it toward the door, but I step into Priya's path before she can follow.\n\n\"What did you see?\"\n\nShe stares at her palms. \"The trauma pattern. It's wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong how?\"\n\n\"She fought someone. Defensive wounds on her forearms, bruising around her throat. But there's no way\u2014if she was sealed in\u2014\"\n\n\"Unless it wasn't a blackout.\"\n\nPriya's jaw works. She nods once. The corridor outside echoes with Mara's footsteps. If someone killed her during the blackout, they had access. They could move while the rest of us were blind.\n\n\"We need to know who else was mobile,\" I say. \"Check the crew roster. Cross-reference with anyone who has override codes.\"\n\n\"That's half the senior staff.\"\n\n\"Then we narrow it down.\"\n\nMara reappears in the doorway. \"Priya. Inventory check. Now.\"\n\nPriya gathers her kit, movements jerky and too fast. She pauses at the threshold, glances back.\n\n\"Stay sharp,\" I tell her.\n\nShe nods and disappears into the corridor.\n\nI stand alone in the Med Nook. The exam table still holds the impression of the body\u2014a depression in the padding where her weight pressed down. Someone arranged her arms. Someone closed her eyes. Someone took the time to make her look peaceful.\n\nThat kind of care takes time. Time no one should have had during a blackout. I head for the door. Mara's already three corridors ahead, but I can track her by the sound of the gurney wheels on the deck plating. If the logs are corrupted, someone corrupted them. If the seals failed, someone failed them. We're not dealing with a malfunction.\n\nWe're dealing with a person.",

My ribs feel too tight, like the pressure outside is leaking in through the vents. I try another command. The screen flickers, spits out a broken log file. Text repeats in a loop: 'Charity was never meant for you'. Over and over. The words feel familiar, like something in another life.\n\nLinnea's shoulders lock up. \"Is that\u2014\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" The cold spreads from my hands to my chest. \"This wasn't about the money.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI stare at the looping message. \"Someone had a grudge.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nI turn to face her. \"Someone who knew exactly where to cut.\"\n\nHer knuckles go white where she grips the terminal edge. \"Why trap us?

I've been clenching it without noticing.\n\nShe wraps her arms around herself. The condensation on the walls makes everything look slick, like we're inside something's throat.\n\n\"Do you think he's coming for us?\" Her voice drops. \"Or is he just going to wait?\"\n\nI stand up fast enough that the chair scrapes. The sound echoes wrong in this space, bounces back at us from too many angles. I move toward the darker corner where the emergency lighting doesn't reach.\n\n\"We find another way out.\"\n\nThe system voice cuts in again, mechanical and bored. \"Interface terminal disconnected.\"\n\nThen it speaks again. Different this time. The tone shifts lower, loses that automated flatness. \"You have twelve minutes before atmospheric pressure equalizes.\"\n\nI freeze. Linnea's hand finds my shoulder.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" she whispers.\n\nThe voice continues, almost conversational now. \"Aris sends his regards.\"\n\nA hiss fills the room.

Left goes toward the old service elevator. Right leads deeper into the luxury section, where the suites still have their doors.\n\n\"Which way?\" Jax asks.\n\nI look both directions. The elevator's closer. But the suites\u2014that's where people kept things they didn't want found.\n\n\"Right,\" I say.\n\nWe turn together. The emergency light behind us dies.

I press my spine to the wall and count my breaths\u2014four in, four out\u2014while my fingertips trace the seam where two panels meet. Cold. Riveted. The kind of joint that wasn't meant to be pretty, just functional. I've already said too much. The words are out there now, hanging in the recycled air like condensation on glass. A flicker. The overhead strips dim, brighten, dim again. Then a whir from somewhere down the corridor\u2014mechanical, deliberate. I know that sound. Servo motors engaging. A lock cycling through its sequence. My fingers curl.\n\n\"Elena.\" Jax steps out of the maintenance alcove, his outline blurred by the bad lighting. He's holding his tablet against my chest like a shield. \"You can't just\u2014\"\n\n\"Can't what?\"\n\nHe stops. My jaw works, but nothing comes out.\n\n\"You knew,\" I say. \"Don't tell me you didn't.\"\n\n\"I didn't\u2014\" He shifts his weight. The tablet drops to his side. \"It wasn't like that.\"\n\n\"Then what was it like?\"\n\nHis hands twitch. He looks at the wall behind me, the floor, anywhere but my face. \"I thought there was time.\"\n\nA door slams shut somewhere to my left. The sound echoes, followed by the hard clank of a deadbolt sliding home. I don't flinch. I take a step forward instead.\n\n\"Time,\" I repeat.\n\nDr. Kade's voice cuts in from the doorway. \"The threshold has been crossed. The procedure is irreversible.\" She's holding a datapad, stylus tapping against the screen in a rhythm that makes my teeth ache.\n\nI turn back to Jax. \"I'm not asking for anything from you.\"\n\nHe swallows. My throat bobs. \"Then what do you want?\"\n\n\"To finish it.\"\n\nThe grinding sound comes again\u2014metal on metal, closer now. My eyes flick to the door, then back. Jax's face is pale under the amber emergency strips.\n\n\"You should have said something,\" I tell him. \"Before it got this far.\"\n\n\"I *tried*\u2014\"\n\n\"Not hard enough.\"\n\nCaptain Sato steps into the corridor, her uniform crisp despite the humidity. She scans the space like she's already planning an exit. \"You both had time to act.\"\n\nThat's the thing, isn't it? We all saw it. The oxygen readings dropping point-two percent per cycle. The way the CO2 scrubbers started running longer shifts. The way maintenance kept pushing back inspections. But no one wanted to be the one to say it out loud.\n\nI didn't.\n\n\"I let people die,\" I say. My voice doesn't shake. \"Because fear pinned my tongue every time I opened my mouth to speak.\"\n\nThe door behind me creaks. I don't turn. The hinges need oil\u2014they've needed it for weeks. I know the sound.\n\n\"You think this ends here?\" The voice is familiar enough to make my a jolt ran through her. I turn slowly. \"You're wrong.\"\n\nMarcus steps into the light. His maintenance jacket is unzipped, and there's a smear of hydraulic fluid across his left sleeve. He's holding a wrench.\n\nI take a step forward. \"I'm not letting it happen again.\"\n\nThe person I've been waiting for\u2014the one who's been moving through the maintenance tunnels, rerouting air flow, adjusting the logs\u2014steps out of the shadows.\n\nIt's Captain Sato.\n\nShe's still standing beside Dr. Kade, uniform pressed, hands clasped behind her back. But the figure emerging from the access panel wears her face. Same sharp jawline. Same pale scar along the left temple. The double raises one hand and taps her wrist terminal twice.\n\nEvery door in the corridor locks at once. The clang of magnetic seals echoes like gunfire.\n\n\"Section C is sealed,\" the double says. Her voice is Sato's voice, but the cadence is wrong\u2014flatter, mechanical. \"Atmospheric venting begins in ninety seconds.\"",

Condensation drips from overhead pipes onto the grating, each drop a tiny percussion against metal. The air tastes like copper pennies left in saltwater.\n\n\"I'm here for answers, not\u2014\"\n\n\"You know why I had to do it.\" He cuts across me, calm as someone ordering coffee.\n\nMy jaw locks. \"Tell me exactly how you shut down the backup system.\"\n\nAris steps closer. His shoe scuffs against mine on the wet grating. \"Do it for yourself this time.\"\n\nI press back against the console. The edge digs into my spine. Down here, silence amplifies everything\u2014the hum of circulation pumps, the rasp of my own breathing, the thud of blood in my ears.\n\n\"You think you're doing something noble?\" The words come out sharper than I intend. \"You just killed people.\"\n\nSomething flickers across my face\u2014not quite triumph, but close. He leans in until I can smell the recycled air on my breath. \"It's all the same to me now.\" My fingers brush mine where they rest on the control panel.\n\nI jerk my hand back. \"Stay away from me.\"\n\nHe laughs\u2014soft, almost fond. Pulls back with that easy smile that never touches his eyes. \"Don't flatter yourself. I wanted to show you what your work turns into.\"\n\nHeat floods my chest. I want to shove him, want to wipe that smug certainty off my face. Instead I reach for a panel tool, fingers closing around cold metal. \"Move.\"\n\nHe steps aside, watching me with the patience of someone who's already seen how this ends. \"You're still running. I guess that's why you never got it right.\"\n\nSomething shifts in his posture. Danger, or\u2014\n\n\"Elena?\" Mara's voice cuts through from the hallway. Urgent.\n\nAris glances toward the entry, eyes narrowing. \"Not yet,\" he mutters, folding his arms.\n\nI turn as Mara reaches us, her face tight with worry.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\"Backup system's down.\" I don't look at Aris. \"He knows how.\"\n\nMara's gaze snaps between us. \"Why would you do that?\"\n\nHe meets her stare, flat and cold. \"She set this up for them.\" He gestures at me like I'm evidence in a trial.\n\nMara's hands curl into fists. \"That's not\u2014\"\n\n\"Believe what you want.\" Aris turns, already walking away.\n\nI grip the console edge until my knuckles ache. This isn't strategy or leverage. This is personal, and I don't know why.\n\n\"Aris\u2026\" Mara starts, then stops. Her breath hisses out between her teeth. \"We need to fix this.\"\n\nHe doesn't answer. His footsteps fade down the corridor.\n\nMara turns back to me, jaw set. \"Let's get the oxygen running.\"\n\nShe pulls tools from her belt, already scanning the schematics on the nearest screen. I move beside her, hands working on autopilot\u2014unscrew the access panel, check the relay connections, trace the severed circuit. I won't let his twisted sense of justice stop us. There are people breathing shallow in their bunks right now, counting on systems that don't exist anymore. The walls press in with each breath.

Around Linnea's console, people are starting to move without purpose, hands reaching for nothing.\n\n\"Mara!\" Jax's voice cracks. \"What do we do?\"\n\n\"Bell dock. Now.\" Mara doesn't look at anyone when she says it. Then her eyes find mine and hold for a second\u2014she's remembering something I said two days ago about structural failure points.\n\n\"There's no way out for all of us.\" I say it before anyone else can pretend otherwise.\n\nLinnea shakes her head. Tears cut tracks through the condensation on her face. \"We have to try.\"\n\n\"Wait.\" My hands are already on her console, pulling up diagnostics I don't have clearance for. Static hisses through the speakers\u2014our surface connection dying in real time. \"The emergency buoy.\"\n\n\"What about it?\" Mara's tone is flat.\n\n\"It's designed for exactly\u2014\" I stop. The manual override switch is flipped to OFF. Someone disabled it when we first docked. My stomach drops.\n\nJax moves forward, shoulders tight. \"We don't have time for this.\"\n\n\"Can you override it?\" Linnea's looking at me like I'm supposed to have answers.\n\n\"We don't have the power.\" Jax cuts across whatever I was going to say. \"Even if the buoy surfaces\u2014\"\n\n\"Then who stays?\" Mara scans the room like she's already making the calculation.\n\nThe hull groans again, deeper this time. Metal breathing wrong. The sound fills the gap that separated us.\n\n\"Someone has to.\" My throat is dry. \"But we can't just\u2014\"\n\n\"We won't have a choice.\" Mara's already moving past the question, looking for the next problem to solve.\n\nJax jerks my head toward one of the side corridors. \"What about that route?\"\n\n\"Where does it go?\" Linnea's voice barely registers over the ambient noise.\n\n\"Secondary dock. But it's\u2014\"\n\n\"No time.\" Mara turns back to me. Her eyes are doing that thing where she's reading everything I haven't said, every evasion from the past week crystallizing into one look.\n\n\"Oxygen's running out either way.\" Jax's hands are shaking. He shoves them in his pockets.\n\nMara moves to stand next to Linnea. They exchange a look I can't read.\n\n\"Who stays?\" I ask again.\n\n\"Someone goes for the buoy.\" Mara doesn't make it a question.\n\n\"And who leaves?\" Jax is staring at me now.\n\nThe seconds feel physical, like something pressing down. Around us, people are starting to whisper\u2014accusations, blame, the kind of paranoia that happens when everyone knows the math doesn't work.\n\n\"Linnea.\" I force the name out. \"You need to\u2014\"\n\n\"I'm not leaving you.\" She's gripping the edge of her console hard enough that her knuckles are white.\n\n\"Someone has to go.\" Jax pushes the words out like they're costing him something.\n\nThe room feels smaller. The air tastes like metal and sweat.\n\n\"What if I stay?\" Jax doesn't look at anyone when he says it. \"I can try to\u2014\"\n\nMara's eyes narrow but she doesn't argue. The logic is already there, hanging between us.\n\n\"Linnea.\" I touch her shoulder once, then let go. \"Go with Mara.\"\n\nShe nods. Doesn't say anything. Just follows Mara toward the corridor at a near-run. Jax stands there a moment longer. His mouth opens like he's going to say something, then closes. He doesn't need to. I already know what the silence means.\n\n\"Let's go.\" He turns toward the other corridor.\n\nI watch him disappear into the dimness. Each footfall echoes back, getting quieter. The metal groans again, louder now. Then something else\u2014a different sound. Footsteps behind me. I turn. Linnea is standing in the doorway, alone. Her face is pale in the emergency lighting.\n\n\"Where's Mara?\" The words come out wrong, too fast.\n\n\"She told me to come back.\" Linnea's voice is steady, but her hands aren't. \"She said you'd understand.\"\n\nThe corridor behind her is empty. The bell dock is in the opposite direction.",

It's a machine.\" Dr. Kade steps forward, white coat dragging across the grating.\n\n\"Elena,\" Jax says.\n\nI don't turn. I keep my eyes on the far end of the dock, where the bell waits like a mouth.\n\n\"I watched people die,\" I say. Low enough that it doesn't bounce back. \"And I did nothing.\"\n\nJax takes a breath. I don't let him use it.\n\n\"You think I didn't watch?\" His hands grip the bulkhead. Knuckles white. \"I watched you bury the last one.\"\n\nThe bell hums. Low and mechanical, vibrating up through the floor into my teeth. I close my eyes. Open them. I don't want to remember the last place that sounded like this.\n\n\"I don't know what you expect from me.\" I turn to face Jax now. My throat is tight. \"But I know this\u2014if we go in there, we don't come back. Not the same. And if I let someone else make that call, I'll lose whatever's left.\"\n\nJax stares. My jaw works like he's chewing through words. He wants to argue. Tell me I don't have to do this. He doesn't say it. I turn back to the bell. Take a step.\n\n\"You're not ready for what's inside.\" Captain Sato's eyes scan the dock like she's marking exits. \"You think this is about you? It's about the timeline.\"\n\nA voice comes from the far end. Low. Calm. Not Jax. Not anyone I know. I don't need to see them to know they've been waiting.\n\n\"I can't promise you anything,\" the voice says. \"But I can promise you this\u2014if you go in there, you won't come out the same person.\"\n\nI stop just short of the bell's entrance. My heart slams against my sternum. If I fail, I lose my badge. I lose Jax's trust. I lose the only leverage I have left in this place. I look back at Jax.\n\n\"You don't get to walk away.\" Dr. Kade's hand slams the control panel. Sparks fly. \"You signed the procedure. You cross the threshold, or you don't cross at all.\"\n\n\"Elena,\" Jax says. My voice cracks. \"You don't have to\u2014\"\n\n\"I don't have a choice.\"\n\nThe words feel like rust in my mouth. I see the way Jax's jaw tightens. The way my eyes flick to the control panel where Dr. Kade's hand still smokes. He's thinking of the last time I stood at a door like this. The last time I let someone else decide.\n\nI take a step. Then another. I don't stop. I reach for the handle. Cold metal under my fingers. The bell hums again, louder this time, like it's impatient. I pull the door open just enough to see the darkness beyond. My breathing fills the gap between us.\n\n\"You don't get to stop me,\" I say. My hands are steady on the handle. \"Not this time.\"\n\nI push the door open. I step inside.",

She steps closer and places a hand on my shoulder.\n\nI swallow hard. Each heartbeat echoes in my ears. I look around at each person huddled inside: Jax's face pale but set; Dr. Kade watching me like I'm a specimen; Silas's eyes dark with calculation; Priya's calm mask barely holding.\n\n\"We go up.\" My hands ache from gripping the frame. \"But we have to leave someone behind.\"\n\nShock flashes across faces. Denial. Then the weight of it settles.\n\n\"I won't.\" Jax steps forward from the cluster behind me, my voice trembling but clear. \"I can\u2014I'll stay.\"\n\nMy chest tightens at those words. For once, it's not about his brand or his audience. Just survival.\n\n\"Jax.\" I reach for my arm. He catches my hand briefly before pulling away.\n\n\"No.\" He meets my eyes with unexpected strength. \"You go.\"\n\nThe bell shudders as we ascend another increment. Each meter is a reminder of the distance left and the time bleeding out. I turn towards Dr. Kade standing rigid by his console.\n\n\"Why?\" My voice cracks despite my best effort. \"What did you do?\"\n\nMy eyes narrow. He doesn't deny it. He just looks away, across to Silas standing there impassive. Silas shakes my head, dismissing any questions aimed at Dr. Kade. He turns directly towards the bell door where I stand.\n\n\"I'll go.\" He steps forward with surprising determination. \"Let me.\"\n\nMy hand reaches for the handle. I hesitate only a moment before letting it fall back at his touch. This isn't my choice to make. The bell door swings open smoothly, and Silas steps inside without another word.\n\nCaptain Sato's gazes caught mine over my shoulder. She nods once, sharp.\n\nWe move quickly then. No more time for words or doubts. I guide the others past and up, my focus sharpening until every detail becomes hyper-real: the cold bite of air against exposed skin; distant flashes from bioluminescence that seem almost familiar; Jax's face as he looks back at me before disappearing inside.\n\n\"We're not done.\" My voice comes out stronger than I expected. \"This isn't the end.\"\n\nHe nods slowly from where he stands within that circle of light and dark dividing us. The bell begins its ascent, rising steadily through layers of water. Something scrapes against the hull\u2014metal on metal, deliberate and rhythmic. Three strikes. A pause. Three more.\n\nCaptain Sato freezes at the controls. \"That's not possible.\"\n\nI press my face to the porthole. Below us, another diving bell materializes from the darkness, its lights cutting through the black water. The hull bears markings I recognize\u2014the facility we abandoned three days ago.\n\nPriya's voice cracks. \"Elena. The oxygen readings just dropped to zero.\"",

I drag it in through my nose and mouth, chest heaving like I've forgotten the rhythm. Mara slumps on the metal bench beside me, chin nearly touching her collarbone. Priya's behind us, strapping monitors around our wrists and calves, fingers shaking hard enough I can feel the tremor through the velcro. When her eyes land on mine, there's something past relief. Something that looks like dread. Across from me, Jax hunches over his clasped hands. Another medic works around him, checking vitals, but Jax doesn't lift my head. His knuckles are bone-white.\n\n\"Captain.\" Priya's whisper cuts. \"We need to start decompression now or we're looking at pulmonary edema.\"\n\nMara's head snaps up. The exhaustion vanishes, replaced by the hard angles I've learned to read. She nods once. Then she looks at me.\n\n\"Elena,\" she says, jaw tight. \"When Jax's family arrives at port, I need you to\u2014\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe word comes out raw. Automatic. The old reflex kicks in\u2014smooth it over, spin the narrative, make it palatable\u2014but there's no camera here. No brand to protect. Just metal and salt air and the truth that I'm done performing.\n\nMara's eyebrow lifts. She doesn't push. Just watches me for three long seconds.\n\n\"Alright,\" she says. \"Then breathe. You've earned that much.\"\n\nPriya circles back to me with an IV kit. The needle glints under the overhead lights\u2014too bright after days in the dark. She swabs my inner elbow, taps the vein.\n\n\"How's Jax?\" I ask.\n\n\"Stable.\" The needle slides in. I don't flinch. \"But he hasn't said more than two words since we left the Aethelgard.\"\n\nMara shifts beside me. Her shoulders drop half an inch.\n\nAbove us, machinery hums. Waves slap the hull in an uneven rhythm that makes my stomach clench. I can't tell if it's nausea or just the memory of pressure.\n\n\"Why do you think\u2014\" I start.\n\n\"Survivor guilt,\" Priya says before I finish. She tapes down the IV line. \"Fear. Shock. Take your pick.\"\n\nMara exhales hard through her nose. \"We should start decompression.\"\n\nI nod. Across from me, Jax's shoulders hitch with each breath. Too fast. Too shallow.\n\n\"Elena?\"\n\nMy voice is barely there. I turn fully toward him, and he lifts her head just enough that I can see his eyes. They're hollow. Older than they were three days ago.\n\n\"We're free,\" he whispers.\n\nI hold my gaze. \"Not yet. But we're safe.\"\n\nIt's not the same thing. He knows it. I know it. The distinction sits between us like a third person on the bench.\n\nMara stands, movements deliberate. \"Alright.

The ocean pushed against the glass, black and waiting. Voices somewhere below, muffled through steel.\n\n\"Mara.\" Barely louder than my own breathing. \"You didn't tell me.\"\n\n\"I had to protect you.\"\n\n\"I wasn't the one who needed protecting.\"\n\n\"You were.\" She doesn't blink when she says it.\n\nOutside, waves hit the hull. Steady. Violent. The sky's gone dark\u2014clouds piling up from every direction. I press my fingertip to the glass where condensation beads, trace one droplet's path down.\n\n\"I could talk. Tell them everything.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Too sharp. Like I've touched something raw.\n\n\"The surface world. The one who wanted me to fix Jax\u2014\"\n\n\"You did what you had to.\"\n\nI watch her shake her head, just slightly. Fighting something invisible.\n\n\"I'm not just a fixer anymore.\"\n\nHer face softens for half a second. Then it's gone. She knows this version of me. Probably knows it better than I do.\n\n\"You always knew,\" she says, and turns toward the stairs. Light pools at the bottom where it shouldn't, wrong against her silhouette.\n\nI watch her disappear down into the guts of the ship. When I look back at my reflection, there's nothing there but empty space where something used to be.\n\n\"Masks crack.\" Just me and the water. \"Walls talk.\"\n\nMy hands curl tight. Nails dig crescents into my palms.\n\nIf there was ever a time to perform, it's now. The urge crawls up my spine\u2014reach out, strike the glass, make noise loud enough to prove I'm still here. Still real.\n\nI lift my hand. Palm hovering an inch from the acrylic. Cold radiates through the gap. One hit. One crack. One sound to shatter the quiet.\n\nBut that's not who I am.\n\nI drop my hand. The glass stays whole.\n\nI stand there longer than I need to. Let my lungs fill with air that doesn't taste like anticipation.\n\nIn the window: a stranger who survived. No mask. No polish. Just someone caught between two worlds with nothing but glass between them.\n\nI breathe in through my nose. Hold it. Let it out slow.\n\nThe old reflex kicks in\u2014smooth my sleeves, find the next line, fill the silence with something clean and controlled. My fingers twitch.\n\nI stop halfway. Let my arms hang.\n\nThen the lights cut out.\n\nAll of them. The corridor behind me. The emergency strips along the floor. Even the faint glow from the stairwell where Mara descended.\n\nIn the darkness, something moves in the water outside. Too deliberate to be debris. Too large to be anything I want to see clearly.\n\nThe intercom crackles once. Goes silent.\n\nMy hand finds the wall. Metal cold enough to burn.\n\nSomewhere below, a door slams shut with the kind of finality that locks from the outside.",
