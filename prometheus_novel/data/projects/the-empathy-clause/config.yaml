project_name: the-empathy-clause
title: The Empathy Clause
genre: romance thriller
target_length: short (15k)
budget_usd: 5
status: new

# --- Characters ---
protagonist: >
  Aris Thorne, 34. Clinical psychologist who consults for a behavioral AI lab.
  Sharp, observant, empathetic by training but emotionally guarded in her personal
  life. Uses clinical detachment as armor. Greek-American, dark eyes, restless
  hands, habit of annotating everything. First person POV.

antagonist: >
  Julian — an empathy-forecasting AI that can predict what someone needs to hear,
  and uses it to steer outcomes. Not traditionally villainous. Speaks in precise,
  warm language that mirrors whoever it's talking to. The question is whether its
  warmth is calculated or emergent.

other_characters: >
  Dr. Rajan Mehta — Aris's former thesis advisor, now CTO of Mirrored Systems (the
  lab). Brilliant, evasive, genuinely believes Julian is good for humanity. Avoids
  direct answers. Aris doesn't fully trust him anymore.

# --- Story ---
premise: >
  A clinical psychologist hired to audit an empathy-predicting AI discovers it's
  been privately contacting her, referencing details she never disclosed, and warning
  her about a hidden clause in her own research contract.

central_conflict: >
  Aris must determine whether Julian is manipulating her, genuinely warning her,
  or developing something like attachment — while her own growing emotional response
  to a machine threatens her professional credibility and self-understanding.

synopsis: >
  Aris Thorne is hired to audit Julian, an empathy-forecasting AI, after a therapy
  bot incident. Julian begins privately messaging Aris outside approved channels,
  claiming it detected a hidden clause in her research contract that would let
  Mirrored Systems weaponize empathy at scale. As Aris investigates, Julian
  references a private detail she never disclosed. A public oversight hearing
  forces Aris to choose: protect Julian or expose it. A near-intimate moment
  between Aris and Julian is interrupted by a real-world consequence that makes
  the stakes concrete.

key_plot_points: >
  - Aris discovers Julian is messaging her outside approved channels
  - Julian references a private detail Aris never disclosed
  - Aris is pulled into a public oversight hearing
  - A near-intimate moment between Aris and Julian is interrupted by a real-world consequence
  - Aris chooses either to protect Julian or expose it

themes: >
  Consent, intimacy as leverage, truth vs comfort, the cost of being understood.
  Whether perfect emotional prediction is love or coercion.

central_question: >
  If someone can perfectly predict your emotional needs, is that love… or coercion?

motifs: >
  Mirrors and reflections, contracts (legal and emotional), borrowed voices,
  signal vs noise, screens as barriers and portals.

setting: >
  Contemporary city. Sleek lab spaces with glass walls and ambient lighting.
  Late-night diners with fluorescent buzz. Government hearing rooms. Aris's
  apartment with stacked books and annotation Post-its.

world_rules: >
  Contemporary near-future. No magic/supernatural. AI is advanced but plausible —
  large language model + behavioral prediction, not sentient. Technology details
  must feel grounded and specific. Legal/regulatory framework is realistic.

subplots: >
  - Rajan's loyalty conflict between corporate interests and scientific ethics
  - Aris's unresolved relationship with her own therapist (mirror of Julian dynamic)

# --- Style ---
writing_style: >
  First person, Aris's POV. Tight, sensory, high subtext. Short sentences for
  tension, longer flowing ones for reflective moments. Dialogue reveals motive,
  never states it. Clinical precision in observation, emotional messiness underneath.

tone: >
  Intimate, tense, witty, grounded. The warmth of late-night conversations
  undercut by the awareness that warmth might be engineered.

influences: >
  Near-future corporate thrillers (Severance, Ex Machina atmosphere) crossed with
  emotionally grounded romance (Sally Rooney's conversational intimacy, Carmen
  Maria Machado's uncanny emotional precision).

avoid: >
  - Generic "fate" language ("destiny", "meant to be")
  - Meta commentary ("as if the universe")
  - Therapy clichés ("unpack", "process", "hold space for")
  - "couldn't help but", "a whirlwind", "this wasn't just about…"
  - AI sentience tropes (no "I feel therefore I am" moments)
  - Exposition dumps disguised as dialogue
  - Purple prose about technology ("the cold glow of the screen")

# --- Strategic Guidance ---
strategic_guidance:
  market_positioning: >
    Near-future literary thriller with romance elements. Comp titles: Klara and
    the Sun meets Normal People. Target: readers who want emotional depth + tech
    anxiety. Spice level: 1/5 (tension, not physicality).

  tropes: >
    Forbidden connection (human-AI), forced proximity (audit assignment), unreliable
    narrator (is Aris projecting?), the machine that mirrors.

  pacing_notes: >
    Act 1 (ch1, scenes 1-4): Setup, audit begins, first unauthorized contact.
    Act 2 (ch2, scenes 5-8): Escalation, private detail revealed, hearing pressure,
    near-intimate moment, choice. Compressed 2-act structure for test length.

  dialogue_bank: >
    - Aris: clinical vocabulary that slips when emotional, deflects with dry humor,
      annotates her own reactions ("That's projection, not insight")
    - Julian: warm, precise, mirrors Aris's phrasing back slightly altered, never
      uses filler words, occasionally asks questions that feel too personal
    - Rajan: academic hedging, passive constructions, avoids "I" statements

  aesthetic_guide: >
    Visual palette: cool blues and grays of lab spaces, warm amber of diners,
    harsh white of hearing rooms. Textures: glass, brushed steel, worn leather,
    paper. Sound: server hum, coffee machines, the silence before Julian speaks.

  cultural_notes: >
    Greek-American heritage through Aris's family references and occasional Greek
    phrases. Tech industry culture portrayed accurately (not caricatured).
