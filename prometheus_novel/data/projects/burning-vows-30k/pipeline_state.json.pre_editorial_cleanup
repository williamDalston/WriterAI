Stripped of sarcasm under Mediterranean heat, Lena (terrified of becoming her mother) and Marco (haunted by a parallel family tragedy) must choose whether self-protection or terrifying vulnerability will define the rest of their lives.",

Fiercely loyal to the few people who've earned her trust, particularly Sofia. Perfectionist who masks anxiety with over-preparation and control. Deeply empathetic despite her cynical profession, which is why divorce cases gut her more than she admits. Stubborn pride that makes apologizing feel like swallowing glass. Secret romantic who's buried that part of herself so deep she's almost convinced it doesn't exist. Switches to rapid Spanish when overwhelmed, emotional, or trying to process something she can't face in English.",
      "backstory": "Grew up watching her parents' passionate marriage turn toxic—screaming fights, thrown dishes, her mother's tears behind closed doors. At 16, found her father's affair evidence and kept the secret for months, believing she could fix things. When her mother finally left, Lena blamed herself for not speaking up sooner. Threw herself into academics, then law school, specializing in divorce as both penance and protection. The one-night stand with Marco three years ago happened during the worst case of her career—a custody battle that ended with a child in the hospital. Marco saw through her armor for one night, and she's been terrified of that vulnerability ever since.",

      "arc": "Starts as a woman who's convinced herself that cynicism equals wisdom and that seeing through romantic illusions makes her strong. Through forced proximity with Marco and witnessing genuine love around her, she discovers that her 'realism' is actually fear wearing a sophisticated disguise. Ends as someone who chooses vulnerability not because it's safe, but because it's the only way to truly live.",
      "voice": "Sharp, quick wit with legal metaphors peppered throughout ('I object,' 'sustained,' 'leading the witness'). Drops into Spanish when emotional: 'Dios mío,' 'Ay, por favor,' 'Qué desastre.' Self-deprecating humor to deflect serious moments. Clipped, professional tone when defensive, but voice softens and sentences flow longer when she's genuinely moved. Butchers Italian pronunciation endearingly.",
      "signature_behaviors": "Tugs at escaped curls when nervous. Straightens already-straight objects when anxious. Goes for runs to think through problems. Checks her phone compulsively during emotional conversations. Makes lists for everything, including pros and cons of feelings. Switches languages mid-sentence when flustered. Crosses arms when feeling attacked, uncrosses them when ready to trust.",
      "relationships": "Sofia: Best friend since law school, the sister she chose. Marco: The man who cracked her open and the one she's most afraid of.

Warm brown eyes with gold flecks that become more pronounced when he laughs, which he does often despite his hidden pain. Tall and lean with broad shoulders, callused hands from weekend carpentry projects he uses to quiet his mind. Has a habit of running those hands through his hair when thinking. Small scar through his left eyebrow from a childhood accident with his younger brother. Dresses casually but well—linen shirts rolled to the elbows, dark jeans that fit perfectly, expensive watch that was his brother's.",
      "personality": "Naturally charismatic with an easy laugh and the ability to make anyone feel like the most interesting person in the room. Deeply family-oriented but carries crushing guilt over his brother's death that he hides behind charm and helpfulness. Perceptive about others' pain because he's intimately familiar with his own. Patient and persistent when he wants something, but respectful of boundaries. Has a tendency to fix things and people, which sometimes comes across as controlling. Genuinely kind but struggles to forgive himself for past mistakes.",
      "backstory": "Grew up in a tight-knit Italian-American family in Boston. Always the responsible older brother to Luca, who was born when Marco was 15. Felt more like Luca's father than brother, especially after their dad died when Luca was 12. The night Luca died in a car accident at 19, he'd called Marco for a ride home from a party, but Marco was on a date and let it go to voicemail. Luca drove drunk and crashed. Marco has spent the last four years believing that if he'd just answered his phone, his brother would be alive. Threw himself into work as a successful architect but struggles with relationships because he can't bear the thought of failing someone else he loves.",

Through his connection with Lena and confronting his family's grief, he learns that carrying guilt doesn't honor his brother's memory—living fully does. Ends as someone who can accept forgiveness and offer it to others.",
      "voice": "Warm, slightly teasing tone with occasional Italian phrases ('bella,' 'cazzo,' 'bene'). Speaks with his hands. Voice gets quieter and more serious when discussing his brother or genuine emotions. Uses gentle humor to defuse tension but knows when to be direct. Calls people by affectionate nicknames.",
      "signature_behaviors": "Runs hands through hair when thinking or stressed. Touches people when he talks—hand on shoulder, brief touches to arm or back. Cooks when anxious (learned from his nonna). Always holds doors, pulls out chairs—old-fashioned manners his mother drilled into him. Checks his phone obsessively on anniversaries of his brother's death. Makes things with his hands when he can't sleep.",
      "relationships": "Dante: Cousin and best friend, the brother who lived. Lena: The woman who saw through his charm once and terrifies him by doing it again. Gianna: His mother, who he's desperate to make proud again after feeling like he failed her with Luca's death. Luca: His deceased brother, whose memory both haunts and motivates him."

Quietly manipulative in the way of someone who genuinely believes she knows what's best for everyone. Fiercely protective of her friendships. Romantic to her core but practical about how to get there. Patient and strategic—will orchestrate situations for months to get the outcome she wants.",
      "backstory": "Met Lena in law school where Sofia was studying corporate law. Watched Lena build walls after every romantic disappointment and decided someone needed to look out for her. Has always been the friend who remembers birthdays, organizes group trips, and somehow knows exactly what everyone needs to hear. Fell for Dante hard and fast, but was strategic about winning over his family. Knew about Lena and Marco's one-night stand because Lena called her drunk and crying afterward—the only time Sofia's ever heard Lena truly vulnerable about a man.",

Medium height with a stockier build than Marco, the kind of guy who looks like he gives great hugs. Warm brown eyes that crinkle at the corners from smiling, olive skin, and dark hair he keeps shorter than Marco's. Has his father's strong jaw and his mother's kind eyes. Dresses casually—khakis, polo shirts, comfortable shoes. Always looks slightly rumpled in an endearing way.",
      "personality": "Genuinely easy-going with a gift for making people feel comfortable. Natural peacekeeper who can defuse tension with humor or genuine interest in others.

Has never met a stranger, remembers everyone's names and stories.",

Lost his father young, which made him appreciate family even more. Worked his way through college, now manages a successful restaurant in Boston.

Has old-world values about marriage and family that clash with modern realities. Proud, stubborn, but ultimately fair when given time to process.",
      "backstory": "Immigrated from Italy as a young bride, built a life in Boston's North End. Lost her husband to a heart attack when the boys were teenagers, raised them largely alone. Luca was her baby, the unexpected late-in-life child who brought joy back after her husband's death. His death nearly destroyed her—she sees threats to her family everywhere now. Disapproves of Lena not because she dislikes her personally, but because she represents everything Gianna fears: modern women who don't value family, careers that destroy marriages, cynicism about love.",

      "content": "The knife slides across my palm before I realize I'm bleeding.\n\nI'm standing on a rain-slicked rooftop at midnight, watching crimson drops hit the stone beside a framed photograph that shouldn't exist anymore. The pain is sharp and clean—nothing like the dull ache that's been living in my chest for three years. I press my thumb against the cut and stare at the picture: my father's arm around my mother's shoulders like a promise that unraveled, my mother's laugh frozen and luminous, my own hair younger and straighter. My scar presses against the glass when I hold it close. The city exhales below me—diesel and hot pretzel and the faint, wrong scent of burnt sugar from a food stall two blocks over.\n\nI rub the raised skin and mutter, \"Ay, per favore,\" then slide the frame into the suitcase's outer pocket and zip it shut. A glossy Amalfi brochure flutters against my thigh, rainwater beading along my carry-on handle. The parapet gleams slick with rain, pigeons having claimed the place as theirs.\n\nMy phone lights up against the suitcase. Sofia's name glows on the screen for three rings, my thumb hovering over the answer button. When I hit speaker Sofia fills the rooftop like a warm, stubborn current.\n\n\"You cannot leave without giving me final approval on the seating chart.\" My voice crackles through static as she shifts the phone. \"Nonna Vitale and Gianna at the same table? Recipe for disaster.\"\n\nI laugh, sharp and reflexive. \"Objection.\"\n\n\"Overruled. I'm the bride, I'm the judge.\" She launches into details—flower colors, the best man speech order, why Dante has to sit by the window. \"Also... maybe sit next to Marco?\"\n\nMy free hand finds the zipper pull on my suitcase, works it back and forth. \"I need final headcount by tomorrow morning. And confirmation on the venue's sound system.\"\n\n\"Lena.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Promise me you won't be weird about this.\"\n\nThe word weird hangs between us, sharp enough to cut. I press my thumb against the phone's edge until it hurts. \"I'll handle the logistics.\"\n\n\"That's not what I asked.\"\n\nMarco's text burns in my pocket—two words that refuse complex punctuation. I pull out the phone and read it aloud because saying a thing once makes it less charged.\n\n\"He texted 'hey bella.'\" I try on indifference like a stiff coat.\n\nSofia's exhale comes through the speaker. \"And?\"\n\n\"And nothing.\" My chest tightens. I run numbers in my head the way I used to run deposition outlines: gate thirty-two, boarding ninety minutes, carry-on only, check the charger. I fold the brochure, sliding it into the suitcase beside the photo. The rooftop chair's plastic shows old coffee rings and someone peeled off a price tag that left behind sticky residue. I straighten the suitcase handle, check my passport again.\n\nThe taxi app pings. \"Promise me you won't make this about you.\"\n\nI let the rain fill the space where an answer should be. My thumb finds the zipper and I slide the frame out, press the photograph flat to my chest.\n\n\"I won't promise that.\"\n\nI can hear her inhale on the other end.\n\nBy morning, I'm pacing the terminal with my phone pressed to my ear. My hands shake as I pull the phone back out and tap Marco's name. The weight of the call is easier than pretending nothing is stacked on the scale. It rings twice and then he says, same soft cadence he always uses—\n\n\"Ciao, bella—\"\n\n\"Don't.\" The word cuts through rain and static. \"Don't call me that unless you plan to explain what happened three years ago.\"\n\nSilence stretches across the line. A car horn blares somewhere in his background.\n\n\"Bar by departures. Forty minutes.\" I tuck the frame back into the pocket. \"Come alone.\"\n\n\"Lena, wait—\"\n\nI hang up before he can find an excuse, zip the suitcase closed, shoulder it, and step into the rain toward the curb where the taxi waits.\n\nTwenty minutes later, I'm sliding out of the backseat at the terminal.\n\nThe bar smells like stale beer and industrial coffee.",

      "content": "\"—so here's to risking it all,\" Sofia said, slicing the lemon tart with a precise, theatrical knife stroke that made the plate sing, and then she tossed a Cantonese line so fast and bright that half the table laughed before the fork hit the porcelain. The restaurant quieted as if someone had spun the background noise down; the espresso machine wheezed behind the bar, and there was a chip in my water glass rim that caught against my lip.\n\nThe citrus scent from the tart mixed with the lingering garlic from dinner, creating something almost medicinal. I pressed my tongue against the chip, feeling its sharp edge like a tiny reminder of imperfection in an otherwise polished evening.\n\nSofia's eyes landed on me like a spotlight, and she lifted her glass even though she wasn't done speaking. She cleared her throat. \"For those of you who don't speak Cantonese—\" Her grin widened. \"—I said 'to the one I love.'\" The table leaned forward with anticipation.\n\nThe warmth in their faces felt foreign, like watching a movie through glass. I traced the stem of my wine glass with one finger, the condensation leaving a wet trail that evaporated almost instantly under the restaurant's heat.\n\nDante brushed crumbs from his napkin in a way that made him look like he was clearing a path, not a table. \"Most people just say 'cheers,' babe.\"\n\nSofia nudged his shoulder. \"Where's the poetry in that?\"\n\nMarco pushed his sleeves up past his wrists. \"We're still recovering from your rehearsal dinner speech.\"\n\nThe memory of that speech—Sofia's voice breaking when she talked about finding your person—made my chest tighten. I'd stood at the back of the rehearsal dinner, watching couples lean into each other, their hands finding each other automatically across white tablecloths.\n\nI pulled my shoulders back. \"Objection.\" I set my fork down with deliberate calm, licked lemon custard off my thumb. \"Leading the witness.\"\n\nSofia's hands flattened against the table. \"Life's nothing without calculated risks.\" Those dark eyes fixed on me. \"Right, Lena?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air like smoke. Around us, other diners continued their conversations—the soft murmur of a couple at the corner table, the clink of silverware against ceramic, the distant hiss of the kitchen. But our table had gone still, waiting.\n\nMy gaze locked on hers. Discomfort crawled up my spine like static. I searched for the right deflection. \"Sustained. But this court has a history of questionable verdicts.\"\n\nDante snorted, spilling wine across the white linen. \"Defense rests?\"\n\nMarco reached for his napkin without looking at me. \"Depends on the evidence.\"\n\nThe wine stain spread like a small confession. I watched Marco fold the stained corner under itself, hiding the evidence with practiced efficiency.\n\nMy phone buzzed against the linen, and I grabbed it like a lifeline, standing abruptly. The chair legs scraped against the floor. \"Flight update.\"\n\nThe restaurant's ambient noise rushed back in—conversations from neighboring tables, the gentle scrape of plates being cleared, the soft jazz playing overhead. My heart hammered against my ribs, and I'd been holding my breath.\n\nSofia caught my eye, mouthed something that looked suspiciously like \"coward,\" then took an innocent sip of wine. I turned toward the exit, but Marco's voice stopped me cold: \"Lena, wait.\"",

      "content": "My suitcase struck the sun-warmed stone and pigeons exploded into the air like someone had finally read the fine print on the morning. A gust seized a linen sample from my bag; it slapped my shin, a pale square of unbleached cloth that smelled of starch and sea salt, and I crouched to snatch it before it skittered over the edge. My shoulder jerked and a curl escaped; I pushed it back behind my ear. The scent—thin linen, lemon blossoms—pulled a memory taut. Marco's shirts had been rough at the collar, with tobacco on the cuff and citrus rinds pressed into the fabric. I clutched the sample tighter.\n\n\"You the wedding lady?\" a voice asked, clipped, practical. He had fingers that stared like they had handled a hundred ceremonial ropes, knuckles bright where the sun hit, and a salt-and-espresso tan that declared him local before he opened his mouth. He wiped his palm on his pants before extending it.\n\n\"Enzo. Sofia called—said you'd be here before the roosters.\"\n\nI shook his hand, measuring the calluses against my own. \"Early bird catches the vendors.\"\n\nHis weathered face cracked into a grin. \"Americans. Always rushing somewhere.\"\n\nBehind him, Dante descended the steps carrying a tray with two espressos and a smear of flour on his cheek like a badge. His linen shirt was splattered with something pale and beautiful. He set the tray down with care that made the cups sing against the stone.\n\n\"So you're the one with the lists.\" He brushed flour from his hands, grinning. \"Sofia said you'd arrive with battle plans.\"\n\nI straightened, pulled the linen sample taut between thumb and forefinger to check the weave—coarse enough to breathe, fine enough to photograph well. \"Just doing my job.\"\n\nDante's eyes crinkled. \"Which is?\"\n\n\"Making sure your wedding doesn't become a disaster movie.\"\n\nEnzo produced a binder from under his arm as if it had been waiting at the door since Sofia booked the monastery. The cover was scuffed, the label hand-lettered, and inside, in a neat avalanche of tabs and invoices and contracts, was the vendor list and a receipt stamped with a number that made me do the quick mental math that keeps me from spiraling: primo deposito €4,500, catering deposit owed by next Tuesday, transport guests from Positano €600 plus tip. My shoulders dropped a fraction. Numbers didn't plead.\n\nI flipped through tabs with practiced efficiency, fingers making tiny legal motions. \"Chair supplier?\"\n\n\"Napoli,\" Enzo said, tapping a diagram with a scarred finger. \"Wood, folding. Not cheap.\"\n\n\"Contact info? Deposit status?\"\n\nDante leaned closer, his breath warm with espresso. \"Breathe, counselor. Everything's handled.\"\n\nHis hands were broad and smelled of basil when he gestured toward the catering tab.\n\nI stared up from the binder. \"Define 'handled.'\"\n\n\"Paid, confirmed, triple-checked.\" He touched the corner of the page, leaving a small grease smudge. \"What else you need?\"\n\nEnzo cleared his throat, sliding a photocopied invoice across the stone. \"Gianna left the seating chart. Exact placement for the chapel.\"\n\nSofia's signature sat at the bottom with a handwritten note in careful script: 'Favor le grapes for Sunday—Dante.'\n\nI scribbled notes in my notebook—neat as a summons—then looked up at the terrace that folded away into lemon trees and the sea beyond the cliff, at the nave of the monastery repurposed with white chairs and lanterns.\n\nThe monastery smelled of old limewash and frying garlic somewhere distant; a sun-bleached plastic water bottle had lodged in the drainpipe near the third step, half-covered in sand, the supermarket label flaking off with a barcode that didn't belong in a place posted on travel brochures. That little wrongness kept me honest. But then I reached out to touch the warm stone wall, feeling the ancient texture under my palm, the way centuries of weather had smoothed the edges.\n\nI snapped the binder shut. \"Nobody shows up without signed contracts.\"\n\nDante crossed his arms, flour rubbing into his cuff. \"You always this trusting?\"\n\n\"I'm a divorce attorney. Trust is a luxury I can't afford.\"\n\nHe studied my face for a long moment. \"Must get lonely.\"\n\nThe words hit closer than I expected. I tucked the linen sample back into my bag, burying the memory of Marco's shirts under the fabric like evidence sealed away.\n\nDante stepped closer, close enough that I could see the gold flecks in his dark eyes, close enough that his voice dropped to something meant only for me.\n\n\"You know what I think?\" he said, his thumb brushing flour from the edge of the binder still clutched in my hands. \"I think you came here for more than just Sofia's wedding.\"\n\nMy breath caught. The way he said it—not a question, but a recognition of something I hadn't even admitted to myself.\n\n\"I think,\" he continued, his voice soft as the morning breeze carrying lemon blossoms, \"you're running from something.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Monastery courtyard, early afternoon. The paper crinkled under my thumb, and the purple ink bled into my skin like a bruise. EXCLUDE. Block letters that devoured half the margin, written next to my name in neat columns that looked like a hit list. I held the folded paper out to Marco, my hand steady even though my pulse hammered against my throat. \"Explain this.\"\n\nHis face went blank. The easy smile vanished like someone had flipped a switch, and I understood why Sofia had said \"Marco's in the courtyard\" like a warning.\n\nThe afternoon glare bounced off the white stone so hard I squinted. I pressed the binder against my ribs until the metal rings bit through my shirt. The courtyard reeked of something burnt—not cigarettes, something chemical that clung to the fountain's base like a stain someone had given up scrubbing. Gianna watched me with that bookkeeper smile, tallying something. Dante shuffled his feet.\n\n\"Thought you should know,\" Sofia said, her voice all honey over broken glass.\n\nMarco walked in like he owned the place. Probably did. His forearms were brown from actual sun, not a gym, and when he set down his leather portfolio it made that expensive thunk only real leather makes. The clasp popped open and papers scattered—blueprints, sketches, something with his handwriting bleeding purple ink where his thumb had smudged it.\n\n\"Merda,\" he muttered, crouching to gather the mess. His fingers moved careful around the wet ink, spreading it worse. When he stood, his smile hit me direct. \"Ciao, Lena.\"\n\nI dropped the binder on the stone bench because I needed my hands free for this conversation. \"Hold on.\"\n\nMarco's eyebrows lifted.\n\n\"You can't be best man and wedding planner.\" I tucked a curl behind my ear. \"That's a conflict of interest.\"\n\nSofia laughed, the sound ricocheting off the monastery walls. \"Honey, he volunteered.\"\n\nDante spread his hands like he was offering communion. \"Marco handles all the family stuff.\" He glanced at his aunt. \"Keeps everyone from—\"\n\n\"From killing each other,\" Marco finished. His shoulders went tight. He smoothed one of his sketches flat against the bench, and the purple ink bled into the stone where the paper's edge hung over. \"Mamma gets... she needs someone who can navigate the minefield.\"\n\n\"Without detonating anything important,\" Dante added quietly.\n\nGianna's chin lifted. \"I am perfectly reasonable.\"\n\n\"Of course you are.\" Dante's voice was too quick, too bright.\n\nI pressed my thumb to the sketch to keep it from sliding toward the fountain, and something crinkled underneath. Another piece of paper, smaller, folded tight. The purple smudge came off on my skin as I worked it free. Same handwriting, but this was a list. Names in neat columns, and next to one of them—mine—someone had written EXCLUDE in block letters that devoured half the margin.\n\nI peeled the paper free and held it out to Marco. \"Explain this.\"\n\nMarco took the paper like it might bite him. His eyes tracked across the writing, and I watched his jaw work as he read. The fountain gurgled behind us, the only sound cutting through the sudden silence. A bead of sweat rolled down his temple despite the shade from the monastery's ancient walls.\n\n\"This isn't...\" He stared up at me, then at Sofia, then back at the paper. \"This is from weeks ago. Before we knew you were coming.\"\n\n\"Before you knew I existed, you mean.\" I crossed my arms, the stone bench warm against my thighs where I leaned back. \"So someone just preemptively decided I was unwelcome?\"\n\nGianna cleared her throat, a delicate sound that somehow commanded attention. \"The guest list has been... evolving.\" She adjusted her silk scarf. \"There are considerations—\"\n\n\"What considerations?\" The courtroom voice came back, sharp enough to cut. Even the cicadas paused. \"I'm Sofia's maid of honor. I'm already here. What exactly am I being excluded from?\"\n\nMarco folded the paper in half, then in half again, his movements precise. \"The rehearsal dinner.\" He flicked a glance at Gianna. \"It's at Mamma's house. Very traditional. Family only, usually. Some of the older relatives, they have... opinions.\"\n\n\"About outsiders,\" I said. The word tasted bitter.\n\n\"About people who don't understand how things work here.\" Gianna's voice carried that particular brand of politeness that was really condescension wearing a smile. \"The traditions, the expectations.\" She smoothed an invisible wrinkle from her trousers. \"It can be overwhelming for someone not raised in this culture.\"\n\nSofia stepped forward, her face flushed. \"That's—\"\n\n\"Honest,\" I said, surprising myself with how calm I sounded. The rage was there, building like pressure behind a dam, but I kept it locked down. \"You're worried I'll embarrass you in front of the family.\" I straightened, matching Gianna's regal posture. \"Use the wrong fork, speak too loudly, not genuflect properly.\"\n\nMarco's hands stilled on the folded paper. \"That's not—\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" I stared at each of them in turn. Dante studied his shoes. Sofia's mouth opened and closed. Gianna maintained that serene smile, but her knuckles were white where she gripped her purse. \"Because from where I'm standing, it sounds like you've already decided I don't belong.\"\n\nThe chemical smell from the fountain seemed stronger now, mixing with the heat rising from the stone to create something nauseating. I could feel sweat gathering at the base of my neck, but I didn't move to wipe it away. Movement would show weakness, and I'd learned long ago never to show weakness in a room full of people who'd already written you off.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Monastery meeting room, afternoon work session. My phone buzzed against the stone and I swiped without looking. The image hit me like a slap: three tiers of sponge and buttercream collapsed into syrupy wreckage, sugared roses drowning in what peered like espresso. I started typing clause citations faster than I draft emergency motions.\n\nMarco leaned closer, his elbow grazing the binder. Buttercream clung to his thumbnail like evidence at a crime scene. The afternoon heat made the sugar smell cloying, almost medicinal.\n\nThe vendor's voice cracked when I answered. \"We hit the step. I—\" His apology dissolved into Italian fragments that meant nothing to me and excused even less. Static crackled through the connection, punctuated by what sounded like someone sweeping up broken porcelain.\n\nI straightened in my chair, voice cutting through his rambling. \"Stop talking. You have one hour to send me a full incident report.\"\n\nPapers shuffled on his end. Marco muttered something that sounded like profanity. \"Porca miseria, cazzo.\" He dragged his free hand through his hair, leaving it rumpled in a way that made him look younger, more vulnerable.\n\nThe assistant by the door snorted. His reaction made me recalculate. Keep it legal and pressure them for refunds, or lean local and let Marco call someone who could bake a replacement overnight. The stone beneath my feet radiated warmth through my shoes, and I shifted my weight, feeling the slight give in my heels against the uneven surface.\n\nI held up one finger to Marco, then returned to the phone. \"Transport logs. Personnel records. And clause twelve doesn't cover your—\"\n\n\"Signora, per favore—\"\n\nI shoved the phone at Marco because the vendor's accent tightened when he heard Marco's name, and Marco's voice dropped into something softer but twice as sharp.\n\nMarco took the phone, his fingers brushing mine. The contact sent an unexpected jolt up my arm. He pressed it to his ear, his free hand already reaching for his own device. \"Senti, I know a pastry chef. He can be here by midnight, but we need measurements and flavors.\"\n\nSpeed versus precedent. I could demand everything documented and risk losing the practical fix, or authorize a workaround and save the legal ammunition for later. I chose like filing an emergency motion—fast, with contingencies. The monastery bells somewhere overhead marked the half hour with three resonant chimes that underscore the urgency.\n\nI pulled out my notepad, pen already moving. \"Get the vendor to deliver what's left of the cake. I want photos of everything.\"\n\nMarco nodded, switching to rapid Italian with whoever was on the other end. His hand brushed mine when he reached for my pen to jot down an address. Near enough that I could see flour dusting the creases of his knuckles, smell the faint trace of vanilla that clung to his shirt.\n\nHe covered the phone with his palm, eyes finding mine. \"He can do individual tartellette, not tiers, but they can be assembled.\"\n\nThe afternoon light caught the concentration in his dark eyes as he listened to the voice on the other end.\n\nPasticceria Salerno. The name tasted like salvation.\n\nMarco's phone buzzed against the table, vibrating across the stone surface with an urgent insistence that made us both look up.\n\nI ran the numbers: bake time, travel on these twisted coastal roads, refrigeration, expedited supply costs, plus Sofia's patience measured in increasingly volatile units. If Salerno commits by ten, if the vendor surrenders the evidence and the venue allows late delivery, we replace, refrigerate, reassemble. No one posts the disaster on Instagram. The assistant's pen scratched against her notepad, recording details I couldn't hear but trusted she'd need later.\n\nMarco's assistant glanced up from her fabric samples. She tapped her pen against the table's edge, a rhythmic counterpoint to the distant sound of waves against the cliffs below. \"Midnight is cutting it close.\"\n\nWe worked like opposing counsel on the same side. I built the legal framework, he negotiated the ground solution. Twenty minutes later I sent an email that launched with \"Sustained\" and ended with a non-negotiable deadline. Marco pocketed his phone after promising Salerno double overtime, his shoulders finally relaxing for the first time since the crisis began.\n\nThe assistant laughed when Marco delivered another curse in that flat tone that cuts through chaos better than shouting. I slid the highlighted contract clause across the table, the paper making a soft whisper against the stone surface.\n\nMarco picked it up, scanning the text. \"This covers us?\"\n\n\"Better than covers us. It buries—\"\n\nHe met my eyes, then flicked the buttercream off his thumb with a quick nod. The gesture was so matter-of-fact, so practical, that it made me want to smile despite everything.\n\nThe monastery clock chimed twice. We both stood, the movement synchronized without discussion.\n\nMarco checked his screen and his face changed. \"Merda.\" He peered up. \"Photographer wants to move ceremony shots to tomorrow morning. Weather forecast shows rain during reception.\"\n\nAnother variable. I grabbed my phone, thumb already moving across the screen. \"That means re-coordinating with the florist. And checking Sofia's schedule.\"\n\nHe was already dialing.\n\nHours later, after endless calls and negotiations, dawn broke over the monastery walls. Marco checked his screen and his face changed. \"Merda.\" He looked up. \"Photographer wants to move ceremony shots to tomorrow morning. Weather forecast shows rain during reception.\"",

      "spice_level": 1,
      "content": "I fumbled the old brass latch with the spine of my thumb and pushed the balcony door open, the wood groaning like it had arthritis. He was already there—shoulders angled against the low stone wall, cigarette stub ash balanced in the ashtray like a tiny surrender flag, one wool glove draped over the balustrade. A dead moth clung to the string of fairy lights, one bulb blinking over it.\n\nI stepped outside because air moves and rules bend out here. The temperature hit my face first, cool enough to make my cheeks tingle after the stuffiness of the meeting room. He leaned forward to retrieve the glove and his shoulder brushed mine, citrus cologne sharp as fresh orange peel against my nose. The contact lasted maybe half a second, but my skin registered it like evidence.\n\n\"You know this balcony's off-limits.\"\n\nHis fingers stilled on the glove. \"So's the champagne Sofia stashed in the kitchen.\"\n\nThe words came flat, practiced. I pressed my palm against the rough stone, felt grit bite under my fingernails. The balustrade was still warm from the afternoon sun, holding heat like a confession.\n\nHe rolled the glove between his hands like he was checking it for holes. \"Table four, huh?\"\n\nI watched his hands work the wool, methodical as someone counting votes. \"Your cousin's idea of a seating chart.\"\n\nI smiled without letting my mouth curve much. Smiles are evidence and I don't do self-incrimination.\n\nHe laughed, short and bitter. \"Sofia thinks she's playing chess. We're all just pieces she moves around.\"\n\nHis eyes drifted to the cliff, to a light bobbing on a fishing boat. The water caught the last threads of daylight, turning the surface into hammered pewter.\n\nThe conversation slipped sideways because words want escape routes. We traded small confessions instead: he admitted he drinks espresso without sugar, which struck me as both infuriating and oddly specific. I confessed triple-checking the guest list to hide my panic. His laugh when I said it was genuine this time, not the careful sound he'd been making all day.\n\n\"I'd like to redirect.\" I tucked a strand from my face. \"You're assuming the answer.\"\n\nHe spun back to me, eyebrow raised in that way that used to make my pulse skip. \"Counselor, you walked out here on your own.\"\n\nThere we were, doing our old dance—evidence, counters, the ritualized tucking away of anything that might unravel the rest of the week. The fairy light stuttered and steadied. A breeze lifted off the water, carrying the smell of brine and something else, something green and wild from the cliffs.\n\nHe watched me like someone mapping a tricky negotiation. \"I kept Luca together after Dad died.\" He ran his free thumb along his jaw. \"Fifteen years old, trying to be his father.\"\n\nThe sentence landed like a coin on stone—small, metallic, true. He didn't elaborate. His jaw tightened, and I could see him weighing what else to say, what else to keep locked away.\n\nThe balcony door creaked behind us, and we both pivoted toward the sound, but no one emerged. Just the old wood settling, or maybe the wind.\n\nI tasted metal and gripped the balustrade because the sea's salt grew too loud. \"That wasn't your burden to carry.\"\n\nHe smiled without humor. \"Wasn't yours either.\" He set the glove down on the stone, his fingers lingering on the wool like he was reluctant to let it go. \"But we both know how that goes.\"\n\nBecause he named duty, I couldn't name the night. I wanted to ask whether the debt included me, or whether he kept that part in a separate ledger; instead I reached for another small truth.\n\n\"Still curse in Italian when you're frustrated?\"\n\nHe huffed a breath that could have been a laugh. \"Cazzo, sì.\"\n\nThe R rolled like gravel, exactly like permission to cross a line. The sound hit something deep in my chest, muscle memory from nights when his voice had been softer, closer.\n\n\"Some things don't change.\" Then quieter, almost to himself: \"Bella testarda.\"\n\nThe endearment slipped out like he hadn't meant to say it, and his eyes widened slightly, as if he'd surprised himself. We both pretended not to notice the way my breath caught.\n\nWe skated around the big thing—no names, no retellings, only the scratch of wool between us and the tiny, stubborn moth under the fairy light. I counted on my thumb like marking exhibits. The moth's wings were translucent in the bulb's glow, delicate as tissue paper.\n\n\"Two conditions.\" I held up a finger. \"This week belongs to Sofia and Dante.\"\n\nHe nodded, waiting.\n\nI raised a second finger. \"We don't relitigate old cases.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" He picked up the glove, smoothed the wool with his thumb. \"Clean slate.\"\n\nI folded my hand over the wool glove like closing a file. The fabric was soft against my palm, still holding the warmth of his skin. \"Buona notte, Marco.\"\n\n\"Buonanotte, Lena.\"\n\nI reached for the door handle, but his voice stopped me. \"Lena.\" My name in his mouth like a question he'd been practicing. I turned back, and he was looking at me with something that made my chest tight. The fairy lights cast shadows across his face, making him look younger somehow, like the boy I'd known before we'd learned to armor ourselves in law and obligation. \"I never stopped—\" His voice cracked, and he swallowed hard. \"I need you to know that whatever happened between us, whatever I did wrong—\"\n\n\"Marco.\" I stepped toward him without meaning to, my hand lifting like it had a will of its own.\n\nHe caught my fingers, his thumb brushing across my knuckles. \"Tell me you feel nothing. Tell me this is just old habit, and I'll walk away.\" His eyes searched mine, desperate. \"But if there's even a chance—\"\n\nWhy do we always find our courage on balconies in the dark?",

      "content": "The burnt sugar hit my throat like a filing cabinet slamming shut, and through the kitchen's grimy window I could see wedding guests gathering in the courtyard—two hours early and expecting perfection. The baker's trembling hands shoved a dented jar of ruined marmalade into mine, his voice cracking like the hairline fracture running through the terracotta at my feet.\n\n\"Per favore, signora, the oven—\" He wiped his hands on his apron, leaving streaks of flour. \"She died on me. Everything charred, the sugar split, tutto rovinato.\"\n\nA price tag dangled from his grease-stained apron—€3.99, as if the apron had been drafted into crisis management. The monastery clock ticked twice more toward ceremony time.\n\nSteam rose from the industrial sink where he'd been scrubbing burnt pans, the metallic scent mixing with caramelized sugar and something sharper—panic sweat, maybe, or the acrid smell of electrical failure. The kitchen felt smaller with disaster contained in it, walls pressing in like they wanted to squeeze out a solution.\n\n\"How many tarts?\" I asked. Law school taught me to reduce panic to numbers.\n\nHe counted on trembling fingers, flour dust catching in the lines of his knuckles. \"Two hundred and—no, one hundred eighty-seven finished, but the rest—\"\n\nHe gestured at a ruined tray, ash black against white linen. Burnt sugar hit my throat like a filing cabinet slamming shut. He wiped his forehead with the back of his wrist, leaving a streak of cornstarch across his temple.\n\n\"We can try to recook, maybe salvage—\"\n\n\"No.\" I tilted the jar under the light. Peel floated in sticky shards, the color of old church candles. The label read 'Marmellata di Limone—Nonna Rosa' in hand-scrawled ink that spoke of pride and deadlines. The handwriting slanted forward like it was racing against time, just like we were. \"Marco?\"\n\nI turned toward him without looking up from the jar. \"What do you think?\"\n\nHe stepped forward without the performative breath most men take before offering help. His hands closed around the jar with the same economy he used to open doors—fingers long, thumbnail nicked by a ring he'd worn forever, skin warmed by yesterday's sun. The jar made a soft thunk as he set it down, glass meeting steel with finality.\n\n\"Leave it.\" He tapped the lid twice. \"I know a forno that can finish these.\"\n\nSofia's laugh spilled from the courtyard—high and calm. A bell pealed three times. The ceremony countdown turning concrete. I uncapped the jar because the baker expected a verdict. The metal lid scraped against glass threads, a sound like fingernails on chalkboard. I lifted a shard to my tongue and let it sit there: citrus peel that hit the pith first, sugar insufficient to counter the oil, a back note of preserved bitterness that would have been charming with better ratios. The texture stuck like thin lacquer over candied rind. I catalogued the balance the way I'd read a contract for hidden clauses.\n\nThe baker gripped the sink edge, his knuckles going white against the stainless steel. Water dripped from the faucet in a steady rhythm that felt like a countdown.\n\n\"Troppo amaro? Too bitter?\"\n\nMarco pulled out his phone, fingers moving with the same calm speed he'd used arranging seating charts last night. The screen lit up his face, casting blue shadows under his eyes.\n\n\"Dante's kitchen is empty until noon.\" He was already scrolling through contacts. \"I take these to him. We move now, though.\"\n\nI set the jar down harder than necessary. \"Five minutes. And nobody touches the trays without asking first.\"\n\nMarco pocketed his phone and lifted the jar like he was transporting something fragile. The marmalade caught the light, amber and gold like trapped sunlight.\n\n\"Bene.\" He paused at the door. \"You know I can fix things too, right?\"\n\nWe walked to the courtyard with the jar between us, sunlight cutting across stone. A small fly stuck in the marmalade rim as if Amalfi itself wanted input. Marco shouldered past a stack of folding chairs, the metal scraping against stone with a sound that made my teeth ache.\n\nThe sour taste lingered on my tongue, mixing with the salt air that drifted up from the sea. The monastery gate clicked behind us.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Lemon grove terrace behind the monastery, midday. \"No, no—him here, her here, honey,\" Sofia said, sliding a paper card across the miniature mock-table until the corner bumped Marco's shoe. I pinched the card between thumb and forefinger, felt the cheap gloss and a peeling yellow price sticker—€0.49. The lemon grove hummed with cicadas; a lone bee thudded into the string of bunting and fell, legs twitching.\n\n\"You're overcomplicating this.\"\n\nSofia moved two cards with surgical precision and folded her hands. \"Dante by the window so he can work his magic on the cousins.\" She tapped a tiny card with her thumbnail. \"Luca near Gianna, and you—\" She paused, watching my face. \"—beside Marco.\"\n\nThe question sat between us, heavy and unspoken. I could feel Marco's attention shift, the way his breathing changed when he was listening without pretending not to. The morning heat pressed against my shoulders, making my blouse cling to skin in places that reminded me I'd been up too late wrestling with guest lists and vendor contracts.\n\nMarco leaned on the stone balustrade, arms folded, the sun catching a pale scar on his knuckle where skin had healed lumpy. His aftershave carried hints of bergamot and cedar. \"If Lena sits there, I'll take Dante's spot by the window.\" He reached for a card, fingers patient and sure. \"He'll stress-cook himself into a panic during the toasts.\"\n\nThe card trembled slightly in his grip. because I'd spent years cataloging the small tells that meant he was working harder than he wanted to admit. The way his jaw tightened when he concentrated. The unconscious tap of his index finger against whatever surface was nearest when he was calculating odds.\n\nI straightened the stack of cards because my hands needed something to do. The paper edges were soft from handling, some corners dog-eared where Sofia had bent them during her previous attempts at wedding diplomacy. Each card represented a person with opinions about where they deserved to sit, what they deserved to eat, whether the music would be too loud or the wine too cheap.\n\n\"The acoustics by that window are terrible,\" I said, surprised by how normal my voice sounded. \"Dante will spend the whole reception shouting over the echo.\"\n\nDante wandered over with a bowl of salted almonds balanced on a linen napkin, one corner bearing a greasy fingermark. He set the bowl down, the almonds scattering. \"Leave the seating chart alone for now.\" He chimed a fork against the bowl. \"Let it simmer, you know? These things have to cook at their own pace.\" The kitchen-splattered apron at his waist made him look exactly like the person who could fix family arguments with a single well-timed antipasto.\n\nThe memory of another seating chart flashed through my mind—the one from my own case three years ago. Sofia picked up an almond and rolled it between her palms. \"Easy for you to say. You don't have Aunt Francesca threatening to boycott if she's seated near the kitchen door.\" The salt left tiny white crystals on my skin. \"Or my mother asking why we can't just elope.\"\n\nThe mention of elopement made something twist in my stomach. I'd been the one to talk Sofia out of it six months ago, convincing her that a proper wedding would give her the closure she needed after years of false starts with other men. Now I wondered if I'd been protecting Sofia or sabotaging my own escape route.\n\nSofia leaned forward so her chin nearly brushed the pinboard. \"Lena, you promised. Two weeks of logistics, being my legal counsel—\" She dropped her voice. \"And then if it's a complete disaster, you can leave. Think of it as... a temporary injunction.\"\n\nThe legal metaphor should have been funny, but it landed with the weight of an actual contract. Two weeks. Fourteen days of pretending that sitting next to Marco at dinner tables and helping him navigate family politics was just another professional obligation. Fourteen nights of falling asleep to the sound of waves and waking up to the smell of lemon blossoms and the knowledge that this was temporary, that I would leave, that leaving was the point.\n\nI counted the practicalities—the ferry schedule, my clients back in New York who would scream if I rearranged, the cost of a last-minute flight. Then I counted my loyalty to Sofia, which had accrued interest through years of messy breakfasts when one of us had hit rock bottom.\n\nThe numbers didn't add up to a clear answer, so I stopped counting.\n\nI pushed the Marco card closer to him on the mock-table, feeling the pin prick my fingertip. \"Objection sustained.\" A tiny bright dot of blood bloomed on the paper and I touched it with my thumb until the sting steadied me.\n\nMarco glanced down, saw the smear, smiled in that small, private way he does when he registers compromise. The expression transformed his whole face, softening the lines around his eyes that hadn't been there when we were twenty-five and stupid enough to think love was simple.\n\nSofia clapped once, too loud in the lemon-sweet air. \"Perfetto.\"\n\nI folded the paper card into the slot I'd just made, the blood smear disappearing into the crease like evidence I'd never been here at all.",

Enzo set the tray down with a soft clink; the chipped ceramic cup nudged mine and left a ring of damp on the terracotta. He tapped the clipboard so the paper rattled. \"You or him?\"\n\nI lifted the cup but didn't drink, just held it while my pulse hammered against my wrists. The chip was sharp under my thumb—I kept tracing it. Because he was waiting, I read the top line: revised vendor schedule, late-night deliveries, an extra rehearsal for the cousins' entrance, a morning window with the florist at eight. My shoulders went rigid. Enzo watched the paper as if it might sprout an argument.\n\n\"Need an answer.\"\n\nThe printer-ink smell on the board made my fingers itch. Marco leaned on the low wall that framed the grove, tape flakes stuck to the knuckle of one hand where he'd wrestled place cards; when I looked up, the light carved his jaw in hard, clean planes. He shrugged.\n\nHours later, after the family dinner had ended, I found myself back on the terrace. \"I can call after dinner.\"\n\nHis Italian sang in the vowels—short, practical. That answer reached me because Sofia had already built the day into an edifice and the florist's deadline was the keystone; if the keystone shifted, the whole thing would crumble. I wanted to say yes—for Sofia, for the wedding that mattered to her—but my throat closed around the word.\n\n\"Great. Now I'm the deciding—\"\n\n\"You handle timelines.\" Enzo's eyes flicked to Marco. \"Logistics. Two of you, same villa. Sì o no?\"\n\nThe decision stopped being theoretical; it demanded signatures, literal ones. I traced the line of the schedule with my thumb, imagining the two-week block filling up with vendor calls, tastings, and twenty-two dinners where we would be physically proximate in ways I'd avoided for years. The want was there—to help Sofia, to be useful—but it crashed against the fear of what proximity to Marco might cost me. He didn't plead. Marco ran his knuckles against the railing, leaving it ruffled.\n\n\"I'll handle Luca's speech tonight.\"\n\nSofia's face flashed in my mind, trusting and expectant, and something loosened in my shoulders. I set the cup down deliberately, both hands flat on the table.\n\n\"Two weeks. Morning planning, afternoons for vendors, evenings clear for family.\"\n\nIt came out like a contract clause; I meant it. He smiled in that small way that used to undo me and now made me cautious.\n\n\"Two weeks,\" Marco repeated, and the word was not a promise so much as an invitation.\n\nEnzo watched us both, an impartial witness who preferred checkboxes to entanglements.\n\n\"What about—\" I stopped, started again. \"The past stays there?\"\n\nThe past was the clause neither of us wanted notarized. I didn't want a speech. I wanted a boundary that would hold when temptation or curiosity poked at it. Marco rubbed the side of his neck as if erasing words.\n\n\"Private. For Sofia.\"\n\nI nodded, and the motion felt like stepping off a ledge.\n\n\"One more thing.\" I kept my voice steady. \"Separate beds if we're—\"\n\n\"Bene.\" Marco's voice cut across mine. Then quieter, so only I could hear: \"No surprises.\"\n\nEnzo slid a pen across the clipboard; the click on the metal felt small and enormous at once. I signed under the two-week block with three letters that made my hand shake: L-E-N. The pen left a thin, decisive line. I handed the clipboard back and took a deliberate sip from the chipped cup; the limoncello was colder than the air, sharp against my tongue, and the terrace cicadas began their steady counting.\n\n\"I'll stay.\"\n\nMarco's shoulder brushed mine as he collected a stack of place cards; the contact was brief and ordinary and dangerous. His fingers lingered on the cards, so close I could see the small scar on his thumb from where he'd cut himself building Sofia's bookshelf three years ago.\n\n\"Len.\" My name barely above a whisper. When I peered up, his eyes held mine with an intensity that made my breath catch. \"There's something I need to tell you. Something I should have said three years ago.\" He set the place cards down, his hand trembling slightly. \"About why I really—\"\n\n\"Don't.\" The word came out sharper than I intended.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Cliffside terrace at the monastery, late afternoon wine tasting between lemon groves and the sea. The monastery wheel tastes like a dare I shouldn't have accepted. Marco's thumb still lingers against my knuckle where he guided my hand to the ceramic disc, and now the lemon oil burns bright against my tongue while something deeper—sea iron, ancient salt—makes my throat want to correct itself.\n\n\"No.\" The word had escaped smaller than I meant when Sofia first pushed the wheel toward me, but now my fingers drum against the red-checkered cloth—tap-tap-pause, tap-tap-pause—morse-coding her impatience while the citrus-slick light makes the sea fracture into shimmering coins around us.\n\nShe leans forward, her voice taking on that gentle-but-persistent tone I know too well. \"Lena, come on. Just try it.\"\n\nDante laughs from across the table, his hands still dusted with semolina. \"The woman knows her palate, Sof. Let her decide.\"\n\nMarco shifts closer, his shoulder angling toward mine. \"You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.\"\n\nHis voice is quiet, meant just for me, but I catch the slight challenge underneath. Like he's daring me to admit what I'm really afraid of.\n\nI pick up the wheel, turning it between my fingers. \"I'm not afraid of cheese, Marco.\"\n\n\"No?\" He tilts his head. \"Then what are you afraid of?\"\n\nThe question hangs there while I examine the glaze. The wheel smells of lemon rind and something I can't name—sea iron, ancient salt—and the ceramic carries the faint warmth of a thousand hands. The tasting is three motions: sniff, press, roll. I press my tongue to the wheel and the citrus oil blooms like a clean accusation, bright then honest, cut by saline that makes the back of my throat want to correct itself. The wine that follows is less theatrical, more stubborn: white with minerality and a length that makes me slow my breathing while my brain arranges adjectives. I say, in Spanish, \"Dios mío,\" low enough that only Marco can catch it, and he smiles like I just presented a brief that didn't embarrass him.\n\n\"You like it.\"\n\nMarco doesn't ask. He states. Sofia clasps her hands together, barely containing her excitement.\n\nI set the wheel back on the cloth. \"It's... fine.\"\n\n\"Fine?\" Dante raises an eyebrow. \"That's what you say about opposing counsel's opening statements.\"\n\nA small bee has decided the glaze is dessert and hums angrily when my wrist nears. The annoyance anchors me—the cigarette stub lodged in the terrace grout, the sticky smear of someone else's sunscreen by the bench, all the tidy imperfections that keep this from being a postcard.\n\nSofia leans in, her smile shifting into something more calculated. \"Since you two are getting along so well—\"\n\n\"We're not—\" I start.\n\n\"—maybe you could coordinate the vendor meetings next week?\"\n\nShe pulls out her phone, scrolling through what I know is a color-coded list. \"The florist needs final approval, and when Gianna gets here—\"\n\nShe stops herself, glancing at Marco.\n\nMarco's elbows rest on the table now, a deliberate move closer than necessary; his forearm brushes mine, the contact mild but exactly placed. He speaks low, just for me. \"She's plotting.\"\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\n\"And you're letting her.\"\n\nI turn to face him fully. \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\nHis eyes hold mine, steady and unblinking. \"Means you could say no if you really wanted to.\"\n\nThe words land exactly where he aimed them. My fingers worry the edge of the cloth while I search for a comeback that doesn't prove his point.\n\nMarco reaches across the table, his fingers brushing mine as he adjusts the wine bottle between us. The touch is brief but deliberate, and I don't pull away.\n\n\"Maybe I don't want to disappoint Sofia.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\" He lifts his wine glass, watching the sea blink through it. \"Or maybe you're curious what happens if you stop running.\"\n\nThe church bell rings somewhere inland, too punctual to be romantic. Sofia and Dante exchange a look I pretend not to notice.\n\n\"I'm not running from anything.\"\n\nMarco sets down his glass with deliberate care. \"Bene. Then you won't mind working together.\"\n\nThe words hang between us, bold and waiting I'm not sure I want to take, and I know that saying yes means risking everything I've built to keep my heart safe.",

      "content": "He slides the ledger across the crate with a thumb that leaves a dusted crescent on the leather and says, \"My brother would have argued this over a coffee. Sit.\" The pages whisper when I let my fingertips touch them; pencil strokes—slanted, careful—trail names and arrows, Luca's handwriting cramped into margins like he was trying to fit memories into calendar squares. Before I can answer, Gianna's heels click on the stone and the sound splits the morning: sharp, precise, final. Espresso steam fogs my glasses for a second; lemon peels curl in a crate beside us, bright and wet, and the old dolly parked against the wall squeaks a protest where one rubber chunk is missing and someone's duct tape has become its threadbare substitute.\n\nGianna stops three paces away and narrows her eyes at the spread of diagrams. \"This rearranges the family.\" Her voice cuts through the morning air. \"We do not displace the elders.\"\n\nShe places her hand on the ledger's corner like she's claiming territory. Marco inhales; the scent of citrus and his cologne—too familiar, cedar and something warm—fades under the weight of her pronouncement.\n\n\"She wants three tables moved.\" I point to Luca's penciled notes. My finger smudges a mark already there. \"That will—\"\n\n\"Basta.\" Gianna's hand slams flat against the crate. \"No. Tradition first.\"\n\nThe vendor's phone buzzes against the crate; I adjust my sleeve because my hands are already in motion, habit from depositions and crisis calls.\n\nI press my temple and grab the edge of the table.\n\nThe text headline glows: Fiorista Amalfi. The content reads, plain and flat: Sign renegotiated terms by five o'clock or we pull the florist. Two more lines: Extra labor €420. We need an immediate answer. The message is a hard temporal lever; the ledger's pencil marks look abruptly sentimental and impractical. Marco flips the cover back, exposes a page where Luca has penciled three names circled in a child's impatient loop—Nonna's sisters, his godfather—notes that read like small arguments left unresolved. He traces one circle with a knuckle.\n\n\"He hated changes.\" Marco's voice drops to barely above a whisper. His shoulders curve inward. \"He had these seats for reasons.\"\n\nMarco's phone buzzes again in his pocket—another vendor, another deadline.\n\nHis voice thins when he says Luca's name, and where he expects me to be moved by it I feel my posture harden toward procedure instead.\n\n\"Wait—\" The word comes out sharper than I intend. I lay the ledger flat and meet Gianna's gaze. \"The florist is non-negotiable until there's a contract clause allowing amendment without penalty. If we pay the extra labor now, we keep the layout and avoid losing the arrangements—\"\n\nI pause, straightening my shoulders.\n\n\"Simple.\"\n\n\"Ay, per favore,\" slips out under my breath because I hate that simple never is actually simple.\n\nMarco's mouth tightens. He runs his palm flat on the table. \"We can pay. We can pay from the Vitale reserve.\"\n\nHe almost smiles when he says reserve; it is practice at damage control.\n\nGianna's jaw twitches. She touches the gold cross at her throat. \"We do not buy traditions. We move the cards. Respect.\"\n\nHis thumb presses the ledger's corner to keep the page open as if he has to physically anchor Luca's handwriting to stop it floating away.\n\n\"If we move them—three tables—it pushes Dante's catering schedule.\" My sentences pile into logistics like evidence on a table. \"We'd need extra chairs, extra place cards, another server shift. The vendor's price climbs by roughly €320 to reconfigure the layout, plus the florist's demand. If we split the cost, it's manageable.\"\n\nMarco studies me, his hand still tangled in his hair. \"Or I call the florist and tell them we preserve Luca's wishes and pay the fee.\" His voice goes quiet, direct. \"I'll handle Gianna. You handle the florist.\"\n\nHe hands me his phone with a look that asks me to trust competence instead of judgment.\n\nI bite my cheek and grab the edge of the table.\n\nI press my fingertips against the ledger's edge—old tic—because that's what I do when the argument has spun from legal point to personal landmine.\n\n\"So you'll bend the family's plan for your mother.\" My words are clipped. \"You'll concede to her black-and-white rule to keep a vendor, which is practical, sure, but it's also capitulation. We're not negotiating the wedding like it's a municipal zoning variance.\"\n\nThe vendor buzzes again; the florist wants a verbal yes.\n\nMarco's nostrils flare. He steps closer. \"And you'd rather I risk Gianna turning this into a bigger fight that delays everything? We will not lose the florist, Lena. I'm not letting that happen.\"\n\nHe reaches toward his mother with a hand that doesn't tremble.\n\nI snap the ledger closed—sound sharp against stone—and then open it again to Luca's circled names because the sight grounds me.\n\n\"You know this matters to him.\" My voice drops lower. I touch one of the penciled circles. \"You bending is not neutral; it's rewriting the ledger he kept. You promised him—\"\n\nMy throat tightens on the unsaid, and I speak without the courtroom quip: \"This is the thing your guilt makes you good at—protecting everyone by smoothing edges. But smoothing is erasing.\"\n\nMarco's expression bends inward, private and contained. \"Bene.\" He looks away. Then another word, quieter: \"Trust.\"\n\nHe slides a folded envelope across the crate without meeting my eyes—money I can see peeking from the top, numbers annotated in his handwriting—and then picks up his phone to call Fiorista Amalfi.\n\nI rotate my ring and turn the glass slowly.\n\nThe call is three minutes long; the florist grumbles, names rates, asks for a deposit, then accepts a compromise: they will stay with an additional €320, paid today, and two extra hands on the morning of the event to reconfigure. A confirmation text pings: Fiorista will continue; see attached invoice. Gianna marks the ledger with a fountain-pen flourish, as if signing a treaty.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nMarco folds the ledger back into his jacket like he's closing a case. I hand him the invoice; my fingers leave faint prints on the glossy paper.\n\n\"You bent. For her.\"\n\nHe meets my eyes then, his voice low enough for only me: \"For now.\"\n\nWe solve the vendor crisis. We do not solve what it cost between us. Gianna's heels click away, satisfied. I stare at the duct-taped wheel and the lemon peels and the bill, the practical trifecta of what weddings actually are—decisions, numbers, people—and then I say, quieter than I intend: \"This looks like capitulation.\"\n\nHe tucks the ledger under his arm and walks after his mother, and the dolly gives one long, complaining squeak as the morning moves on.\n\nTwo weeks later, I'm sitting in the courthouse again.

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Village night market near monastery steps, lanterns, candied lemon stand. She thrusts a paper cone at me. The woman behind the stand adjusts my hair net with sticky fingers. \"Per fortuna, signora.\" Her tone carries that particular Italian blend of blessing and pity, like she's absolving sins I haven't confessed to yet. The candied peels inside rattle like tiny coins when I take the cone.\n\nI twist the waxed paper between my fingers because politeness is easier than explanation. The vendor — a man with an apron damp at the collar and a gap-toothed smile — wipes his hands on a towel before folding a second bag into my palm. \"Per te,\" he says, pressing it there with fingers still cool from handling sugar. \"Is good, sí? You take for later.\"\n\nThe paper bag crinkles as I shift it, and something about the sound makes me think of childhood candy shops, of promises wrapped in cellophane. The vendor's eyes crinkle at the corners when he smiles, and I wonder if he sees something in my face that makes him want to feed me sweets, some hollowness that sugar might fill.\n\nBehind him a municipal trash bin gapes open, mussel shells glittering like pale teeth and a smear of something oily that has no business near a lemon stand. The smell makes the sugar taste less saccharine and more complicated. A pigeon lands on the rim, pecking at something I can't see, its head bobbing with mechanical precision.\n\nThe market churns around us—voices haggling over tomatoes, the scrape of wooden crates across cobblestones, someone's radio crackling with static and what might be soccer scores. I should leave. I should take the vendor's gift and walk back to the monastery where wedding logistics wait like patient vultures. Instead, I find myself studying the way sunlight catches in the crystallized lime peels, how they look like amber fragments of something precious and lost.\n\nI manage a smile. \"Grazie.\"\n\nHe beams as if I've given him something instead of the other way around. His wife—the woman with the sticky fingers—nods approvingly and turns to help another customer, her hands already reaching for another paper cone.\n\nThe cobblestones beneath my feet are uneven, worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. Each step makes the candied peels rattle, a small percussion that follows me as I navigate between stalls selling everything from hand-knitted scarves to wheels of cheese so pungent they make my eyes water. A child runs past, chasing a soccer ball that bounces erratically off the stones, his mother calling after him in rapid Italian that sounds both exasperated and fond.",

The umbrella shakes in Marco's grip like he's holding a dying bird, and when I look down, the prayer card under my palm is bleeding ink across wet slate—saint's face dissolving into nothing while the metallic taste of fear coats my tongue.\n\n\"He used to leave notes.\" His voice barely carries above the rain. \"Little things tucked in my shirts.\"\n\nThe slate path narrows into a corridor, each puddle reflecting gray sky back at us. I tuck my chin so the umbrella won't tip and listen the way I listen to clients—focused, hunting for the thread that makes sense of messy lives—except there's no case here and I hate wanting to argue the feeling into neat pieces.\n\n\"What kind of—\" I catch myself switching languages mid-sentence. \"¿Notas de qué, Marco?\"\n\nHe shifts the umbrella handle between his palms, knuckles bone-white against the black plastic.\n\n\"'Don't forget to eat.' 'Call mamá.'\" He shrugs, but his shoulders stay tense. \"Stupid stuff.\"\n\nThe rain picks up, drumming harder against the umbrella. Marco's jaw works like he's chewing on words he doesn't want to swallow.\n\n\"But the night—\" He stops. Shakes his head. \"Merda.\"\n\nI wait. In depositions, silence does the work better than questions.\n\n\"I worked late. Some emergency with blueprints that couldn't wait.\" His thumb traces the umbrella's frayed edge, back and forth. \"When he called, his name and thought... later. I'll call him back later.\"\n\nHis mouth goes soft in a way I've never seen at parties, vulnerable as an exposed nerve.\n\n\"Twelve years old when Papa died, and I decided to be the man of the house.\" He looks down at the prayer card dissolving at our feet. \"But I wasn't man enough to—\"\n\n\"Marco.\"\n\n\"—answer my phone.\"\n\nThe legal part of me wants to interpose, to sort responsibility into neat boxes and hand him a list of mitigating factors. Instead I keep my voice flat.\n\n\"That's not how guilt works.\"\n\n\"No?\" Something almost like a real smile tugs at his lips. \"You gonna cross-examine my conscience, counselor?\"\n\n\"Don't.\" The Spanish drops out of me before I can stop it. \"No digas eso. You didn't kill him.\"\n\nHe turns so his shoulder brushes mine. Salt water beads on his collar, tracing the lines of his neck.\n\n\"I kept thinking if I just...\" He gestures with his free hand, grasping at air. \"Held tighter. Controlled more. He wouldn't slip away.\"\n\nThe umbrella trembles in his grip. A delivery scooter coughs somewhere below us, then dies.\n\n\"Thought being harder meant—\"\n\nHis voice cracks and trails off. The umbrella shifts and my knee bumps the prayer card so it slips deeper into the crack.\n\nMy jaw clenched as I pressed my temple.\n\nA sharp crack of thunder splits the air above us, and I flinch so hard the umbrella tilts sideways, sending a cascade of cold water down my back.\n\nI answer him without lawyering it—no cross-examination, no counsel.\n\n\"You're here.\" My voice comes out smaller than I intended. \"Estoy aquí. You're not carrying this alone anymore.\"\n\nHe inhales, a sound more relief than surprise. The cloth of the umbrella makes a wet whisper as wind catches it.\n\n\"Bella.\" It comes out almost like a question, testing the weight of the word. \"Sometimes I wake up and think I should've gone back. Should've died with him.\"\n\nThe slate underfoot holds us like a jury waiting to deliberate. I fold my hand around the umbrella's handle, let my other hand find the small of his back, knowing that if I let him disappear into this guilt the way his brother did, I'll lose him before I ever really had him.\n\n\"So what then?\" I taste bitter coffee and rain. \"¿Qué vas a hacer? Carry him alone forever?\"\n\nHe doesn't answer with words. Just presses closer, and the rain writes a new kind of note across the umbrella's canvas.",

We descend step by step, the spiral pressing the world into a narrow corridor: stone up and stone down and the sea at the end like a patient witness. I grip the rail tighter, my knuckles going white against the heated iron.\n\nHe doesn't mention the wedding now. He watches the horizon as if testing its patience, his jaw working slightly like he's chewing words he won't release.\n\nA gull cries overhead, sharp and sudden, making me flinch.\n\nHis gaze sweeps the coastline, then back to me. \"You won't find this place in any guidebook.\"\n\nThe small pride in his voice makes an old, ridiculous part of me want to correct his grammar in Italian even though my pronunciation will embarrass us both.\n\nI adjusted my sleeve and turned the glass slowly.\n\nThe steps bite into my sandals; each one requires negotiation—shift weight, find the tooth of stone, push off. Citron blossom rides down on the air, but below it runs something more ordinary: the briny tang of algae and the faint, ridiculous memory of a child's plastic flip-flop stuck in a crevice with the price sticker still attached—€3,50—white type on red. My left ankle protests the uneven descent, the old injury from college track flaring with each careful step.\n\nThe cove opens like a gasp. Tide pools hold late-gold light and snap at the soles of rocks; a dead plastic bottle bobs where the swell eddies, its label shredded into a foreign alphabet. I step around a pool and the stone underfoot is slick and forgiving in different places, unforgiving in others. The air tastes different here, concentrated and private, like the inside of a shell.\n\nI gesture at the scattered debris, the plastic bottle spinning lazily in the current. \"You brought me to a crime scene.\"\n\nThe words slip out before I can stop them, because banter rebuilds the scaffolding when tides unsettle everything.\n\nHe laughs, the sound rough and quick against the cliffs. My mouth tastes of salt. His laugh dies into something softer, more careful, and he glances at me sideways as if measuring my mood against the light.\n\nI adjusted my sleeve and pivoted the glass slowly.\n\nHe closes the last few feet without taking his hand off the rail; his arm grazes mine and the contact is small and deliberate, as meticulous as his silence has been. The fabric of his shirt catches briefly on my sleeve, a tiny friction that speaks louder than words.\n\nHe runs his free fingers along his collar, leaving it disheveled. \"Questa cala—\" The Italian sneaks in like a private key. He pauses, switching back to English. \"It's the only place I come when I need to think.\"\n\nHe turns to look at me then, and the light catches a freckle near his jaw. His hand slides from the rail and finds my elbow. The touch is not possessive; it is exact. He leans in. I can map the calluses on his thumb, rough from years of monastery work, from handling stone and wood and the practical weight of other people's ceremonies.\n\nHe kisses me. It is slow at first—lips tasting of salt and sunscreen and the grapefruit soap they use in the monastery bathrooms—and the stone under my thighs presses through fabric I hadn't realized would thin at the seam. My hand goes to his chest the way one puts a palm on a table for balance, except his linen is warm and there is grit in the weave that transfers to my skin. His heartbeat drums against my palm, quick and unsteady.\n\nHis breath is warm against my neck. \"Bella.\"\n\nThe word vibrates through bone, settles somewhere behind my ribs where I thought I'd built better walls.\n\nI press my palms against his chest, creating distance. \"Stop.\"\n\nThe word comes out uneven, and I know that if I don't pull away now, I'll lose the last shred of control that keeps me from falling completely into something that could destroy everything I've worked to rebuild. My foot catches a loose pebble and I stumble once, catching myself on the rail, fingers skittering over stone that feels too smooth, too willing to let me slip.\n\nHe reaches for my face—gentle, hesitant. \"Lena—\"\n\nI shake my head, pulling back further, the tenderness in his touch too much like David's had been in those final weeks when he'd tried to convince me we could still make it work. \"No.\"\n\nI pull back, pressing the pad of my thumb against the edge of a blue flip-flop wedged between two rocks, the €3,50 sticker half-lifted and gritty with salt, and the tacky plastic under my fingertip is absurdly, perfectly ordinary. The tide pool beside it reflects a slice of sky, fractured by my shadow. Why is it that the most beautiful moments always come with the most ridiculous debris?",

      "content": "I scrub orange zest pulp off my fingers at the balustrade and tell myself the sea is a decent witness because salt doesn't gossip. The stone is still damp where the tide reached the terrace earlier, white crystals clinging to my palm like evidence. A moth batters the glass of the lantern. An Illy paper cup, crushed and smeared with coffee grounds, nestles in a crack in the mortar—someone's hurried caffeine, abandoned like a brief. I press my scar into the heel of my hand until it buzzes.\n\nHe doesn't move away. He leans with his hip against the balustrade, hands loose on the iron, watching the moth more than me. \"Say it.\"\n\nI pick at a splinter in the stone. \"What?\"\n\n\"The rules.\" His thumb traces the iron railing, a slow deliberate motion that makes the metal sing faintly in the night air. \"If we're doing this, say them out loud.\"\n\nI straighten my shoulders, summon my courtroom voice—the one that never wavers, never betrays the tremor in my chest. \"Professional boundaries. Period.\"\n\nHe lets out a long breath through his nose. \"Va bene.\"\n\nThe moth bangs again and the lantern stutters. When the light dips I see the line on his jaw where sun kissed him all week, a narrow pale scar near his ear and a freckle that maps toward his collarbone. The roughness at the base of his thumb shows a callus shaped like a crescent—evidence of rope or oars, not just flirtation. My mouth wants to smirk and file that observation under \"harmless charm.\" My brain, however, organizes: Sofia's schedule, vendors, seating, Gianna's list about family photos, Dante's insistence on vintage espresso cups.\n\nThe terrace door slides open behind us with a sharp scrape, and Dante's voice carries across the stone. \"Marco? You out here?\"\n\nI brush salt crystals off my palm, feeling each grain dissolve under the pressure. The motion grounds me, pulls me back from the edge of something I can't name. \"Point taken.\"\n\nHe reaches out, fingertips grazing the salt on my knuckle. The contact lasts maybe two seconds—long enough for me to feel the warmth of his skin, the slight roughness of his fingertips. \"Lena—\"\n\nI pull my hand back, wrap my arms around my waist like armor. The phantom heat of his touch lingers on my knuckle, and I resist the urge to rub it away. \"We compartmentalize. For the wedding, we are...\" The words tangle. I start again. \"Co-planners. That's it.\"\n\nHe runs his hand down his face, leaving it ruffled. The gesture is unconscious, boyish in a way that doesn't match the careful control in his voice. \"I never wanted to complicate things for you.\"\n\n\"Don't.\" I hold up one finger, the same gesture I use to silence opposing counsel. \"We keep it contained.\"\n\nHis hand drops to his side. He stares at the lantern for a long moment. \"Contained.\"\n\nThe moth finally finds an exit and scrapes out of the lantern with a dusty rush, its wings catching the last flicker of light before vanishing into darkness.\n\nI press my temple with my fingertips, feeling the pulse beneath my skin.\n\nI twist the ring on my finger—a nervous habit I usually only indulge on airplanes or during particularly brutal cross-examinations. The silver band catches the lantern light, throwing tiny reflections against the stone. I tuck the grapefruit-scented pulp into the palm of my hand and rub the salt away, watching the granules scatter into the gutter like tiny filings. He watches me do it, patient, not pleading.\n\nI slide my checklist open, type \"confirm floral delivery at 0900,\" and hand the device to him the way you hand over an affidavit—clean, professional, final. He glances at the screen, then back at me, his eyes searching my face for something I'm not ready to give.\n\n\"After this, we make sure Sofia gets her perfect day. No surprises.\"\n\nHe passes the phone back, careful not to let our fingers touch. The deliberate distance feels like a small death. \"Agreed.\"\n\nThe silence stretches between us, filled only by the distant sound of waves against the rocks below. He pushes off from the balustrade and takes a step toward me, right there, and I can smell the faint scent of his cologne mixed with sea salt.\n\n\"And what if I can't?\" His voice drops to barely above a whisper. \"What if seven days isn't enough time to forget the way you looked at me tonight?\"\n\nMy breath catches in my throat. The phone slips in my damp palm, and I grip it tighter, using it like an anchor. \"You have to.\"\n\nHe reaches up slowly, giving me time to pull away, and brushes a strand of hair from my cheek. His fingers linger against my skin for just a heartbeat before he drops his hand.\n\n\"What if I don't want to?\"",

      "content": "The petition had my signature on it—my real signature, the one I'd buried in Brooklyn three years ago—and it was sitting in a chapel laundry basket like God's own subpoena.\n\nI stared at the folder through moth-eaten communion cloth while the sacristan waited with his cheap Bic pen, candle wax under his thumbnail and pew linens balanced on his hip. The courthouse stamp pressed cold against my ribs through the blazer fabric, and I couldn't breathe. My last name sat trapped inside that blue official seal like evidence I'd tried to bury, but here it was—surfacing in a chapel laundry basket of all places, carried by a sacristan who had no idea what he'd just handed me.\n\n\"Può firmare qui?\" he said, holding out a cheap Bic pen with a thumb smeared in candle wax and the laundry basket sagging with pew linens balanced on his hip. I reached for the pen—lawyer reflex—but that folded corner of paper had already caught my eye and the bell in the chapel tolled slow and patient, sharpening everything into focus.\n\nI peeled back a moth-eaten communion cloth with my sleeve and the folder came free, smelling of old incense and orange zest-scented detergent. The handwriting on the petition stopped me cold—I knew that loop in the 'L' and the small, exact flourish on the 'a'. My initial, my signature, printed in two columns, Italian on the left, English on the right. A brittle exhibit tag hooked through the corner with 'Vitale' written across it in a hand I'd read in subpoenas and emailed copies in my Brooklyn past. The petition had been photocopied twice and then refiled, margin notes in different ink, a docket number stamped half on the paper and half on the linen. If Marco's family saw this petition with my real name, they'd know I'd lied about everything—my past, my identity, even why I'd really come to Italy.\n\nThe sacristan shifted the basket higher on his hip. \"È per la firma?\"\n\nHis voice echoed thin through the rafters while his other hand pushed a dust cloth over a cracked brass bell rope. When he offered the pen he left a tiny blue smear on my thumb that I could feel under the pad like a brand. I slid the folder into the inner pocket of my blazer. The courthouse ridge pressed against the scar on my left palm.\n\nMarco's footsteps scuffed the stone stairs below. \"Lena?\"\n\nHis voice carried up warm and curious. The sound of my name in his mouth made my chest tighten.\n\n\"Everything okay up there?\"\n\nThe bell gave a single lazy peal between us.\n\nI forced my shoulders to relax, schooling my expression into something neutral. \"Just signing something for the chapel.\"\n\nThe smile I gave him could have signed off on paperwork—professional, empty, case closed. I slid the pen from the sacristan's hand, signed his receipt, and tucked it into the same pocket as the folder. The sacristan squinted at me but his eyes returned to the linens and the way sunlight through the high slit window painted them the color of egg-white. He muttered something to the room more than to me.\n\n\"Grazie.\"\n\nI descended the stone steps to meet Marco in the chapel's main aisle. Marco came up the last two steps and paused beneath the rafters, close enough that the scent of his cologne—orange rind and something sharp like bergamot—made my temples prickle. My palms went slick.\n\nHe tilted his head, studying my face. \"You sure? You look—\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" The words came out sharper than I intended.\n\nHe reached for my elbow as if to steady me. I stepped back, the folder crinkling against my ribs.\n\n\"Lena.\" His voice dropped lower, more careful. \"What's wrong?\"\n\nI slid the folder deeper so the courthouse stamp couldn't wink at anyone who might glance into my pocket and moved the linen basket so the opening faced away from the stairwell. The sacristan nodded like he trusted me with something he didn't understand, and when he whirled the rope rattled once and left a smear of dust in the shaft of light.\n\nMarco's eyes followed my hand as it vanished into my blazer. One eyebrow lifted.\n\n\"If something's going on with the wedding—\"\n\n\"It's not—\" I met his gaze, then looked away. \"Just... don't mention this to Sofia, okay?\"\n\nHis jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. \"Mention what, exactly?\"\n\nA cold knot settled at my sternum and my gaze swept the chapel—exits, witnesses, the angles where gossip could bite. What was it about Italian families that turned every conversation into a potential deposition?\n\n\"That I was up here. That we...\" I closed the basket lid with my knee, the dull click anchoring the decision in wood and sound. \"Please.\"\n\nMarco studied me for a long moment, something unreadable flickering across his features. Finally, he stepped aside to let me pass.\n\n\"Bene,\" he said quietly. \"But if you need—\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\nI let him reach my elbow and steady me as I stepped toward the stair, the folder pressing against my ribs like a secret I couldn't keep.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Rehearsal under the bergamot-arched pergola beside the cliff, early evening with guests hovering nearby. \"Distruggi matrimoni per lavoro,\" Gianna said, her fingertip pressing the bergamot garland until the rind puckered. The syllables hit like a judge's gavel. I set the rehearsal schedule down on the terracotta step—metal clinking would only make this louder.\n\n\"Let me stop you there.\" I crossed my arms. \"Relevance?\"\n\nI kept it clinical, the way a litigator trims accusations into manageable evidence. The brass bell for calling servers still had its price tag—€3.50—bobbing against stone like something from a different economy. The whole scene smelled more of inventory than ritual.\n\nDante stepped forward, palms open. \"Mamma, please—\" He gestured at the scattered place cards, his voice catching. \"The rehearsal's in two hours.\"\n\nSomeone near the pergola cleared his throat. \"There was a file from the courthouse. Dropped off with the centerpieces.\"\n\nHe didn't mean malice. Just logistics, the way people notice inconvenient facts. The casualness of it slid under the arch and grazed my shoulder. I could feel my pulse tick against my collar, the fabric tightening around my throat. The courthouse file—I'd left it in the storage room, tucked beneath linens that smelled of lavender and decades, but someone must have found it and carried it down with the other deliveries like it belonged among the wedding preparations.\n\nA wine glass shattered somewhere behind me, the sound sharp and final against stone.\n\nMarco moved closer then stopped. Honeysuckle zest dusted his knuckles where he'd been threading ribbon, the faint scar on his wrist catching light. He straightened. His jaw worked once, a muscle tightening and releasing, before he found his voice.\n\n\"What file?\"\n\nQuestion and verdict at once. The vowels folded around consonants like a map of coastline—short roads, steep drops.\n\nMy knuckles cracked as I gripped the edge of the table.\n\nSilence under the jasmine arch. Cicadas lifted then dipped away. Murmurs rippled through the crowd. A napkin, slick with olive oil, slid across a table and stopped at my shoe. I bent to retrieve it, buying myself seconds while my mind calculated damage control. The oil had soaked through the paper, making it translucent, and I could see my fingers through it like an X-ray.\n\nI couldn't let this become a spectacle that would make Sofia fold. I squared my shoulders and moved to the clipboard—if someone was handling facts, I'd rather hold them. The metal felt cool against my palm, grounding me in something measurable.\n\n\"Files get mixed up.\" I kept my voice level, professional. The price tag crinkled under my fingertip. \"Courthouses, catering companies—\"\n\n\"You handle divorces.\" Marco's fingers tightened around the place cards until the edges pressed white lines into his knuckles. \"That's what you—\"\n\n\"Wait.\" I held up a hand. \"That's not—\"\n\nNot a question. A statement of fact, delivered with the kind of careful neutrality that lawyers use when they're trying not to reveal their hand.\n\nSofia stepped between us, her hands fluttering. \"Maybe we should just—\"\n\n\"Basta.\" Gianna's voice cut through whatever hope Sofia had been reaching for. She straightened until her collarbone showed the map of a woman who knew tradition like religion. \"You destroy marriages for money.\"\n\nPrecise English, each word weighted. She said the last four words slower, spelling them against crushed jasmine. The crowd inhaled collectively, their breath a wave pulling back before it crashed.\n\nI rotated my ring slowly, the metal warm against my finger. How exactly did one defend against the truth when it was dressed up as an accusation?\n\nMarco looked down at the scattered place cards. One had fluttered to the ground—Dante's name in ink that smudged where someone's thumb had tracked salt. When he lifted his eyes to mine, they held something I couldn't parse.\n\n\"Is that what this is about?\" His voice was quieter now, almost conversational. \"What happened three years—\"",

Gianna said my name loud enough that even the cicadas paused, so I crossed to the outer wall that runs like a solitary spine above the sea and climbed so I could feel wind instead of whispers. A soggy paper plate with olive pits wedged in a crevice, sticky and ridiculous. The stone under my shoes held the ghost of something sweet—maybe spilled limoncello—mixed with ash from someone's cigarette. The rough limestone scraped against my palms as I pulled myself up, each grip leaving tiny white flakes under my fingernails. My dress caught on the wall's uneven edge, and the fabric give slightly, a small tear that would need mending later. Enzo leaned his shoulder against the rough stone and passed me a dented tin cup. The tea inside smelled sharply of lime peel and sugar. The metal was warm, and I could feel where his thumb had worn a smooth groove along the handle. Steam curled between us, carrying hints of bergamot and something earthier—rosemary, maybe, or wild thyme from the monastery garden. He tapped the rim with that work-worn thumb. \"Keeps the wind out, this wall.\"\n\nThe bell across the cove chimed twice. I wrapped my fingers around the dented tin, feeling the heat seep through my palms. The warmth traveled up my wrists, a small mercy against the evening chill that had crept in from the water. \"Wind's not the problem.\" I lifted the cup to my lips, letting the steam warm my face. Enzo shrugged, his callus catching against the metal with a tiny scraping sound. \"Gossip should respect walls too.\" The sea answered with a slow, indifferent swell that sent spray high enough to mist my ankles. Salt settled on my lips, sharp and clean, washing away the lingering taste of wedding cake and champagne. Marco appeared a little away, sleeves rolled to show forearms that glared pale under the lamp, fingers curled around a ceramic mug that steamed faintly. His signet ring caught the light when he shifted his grip, a thin band that mocked the careful distance he was maintaining between us. The ceramic was one of those thick, handmade pieces from the monastery kitchen—uneven glaze, thumb prints still visible in the clay. He set the mug down too carefully, like it might shatter. \"Why didn't you—\"\n\n\"What?\" My shoulders pulled inward as I wrapped my arms tighter around my ribs. \"Tell you I'm apparently the villain now?\" The tin cup burned against my palms, but I held it anyway, needing something solid to anchor me. Marco's jaw worked. The ring clinked against ceramic as his hand trembled. \"Lena.\"\n\nI turned my face toward the sea, letting the wind whip my hair across my cheek. The salt air stung my eyes, or maybe that was something else entirely. \"Say it.\"\n\nHe stepped closer, and I could smell the soap on his skin. \"You know.\"\n\nThe file sat in my shoulder bag—blue courthouse stamp pressed half into the fabric. I pulled my defense tight and went where defenses live: procedure, precedent, paperwork. The long way back to safety was through administrative competence, through lists and contingency emails and reputational triage. I drafted imaginary emails while the bell tolled and rehearsed my next factual statement like a litigator preparing cross-examination. Because apparently, even my own heart needed a legal strategy.\n\nThe bag strap cut into my shoulder, and I shifted it, feeling the file's sharp corners press against my ribs.\n\nThe familiar ritual of legal thinking wrapped around me like armor, each procedural step a barrier between my heart and the man standing three feet away. Marco stepped closer, near enough that I could smell the soap on his skin, see the way his chest rose and fell like he'd been running. His shadow fell across my hands, blocking the lamplight but not the heat radiating from his body. \"Papers aren't signed.\" His voice barely carried over the wind. His fingers flexed at his sides, and I watched them curl and uncurl like he was fighting the urge to reach for something—or someone. I looked down at his left hand, at the thin gold band that had become as familiar as breathing. When I peered up again, he was within arm's reach, and I could count the flecks of amber in his dark eyes. \"Marco.\" His name tasted like salt and regret on my tongue. \"I know,\" he whispered, and his thumb brushed across my knuckles, feather-light, devastating. \"But I had to try.\"",

The scar on my palm burns where Marco's fingers just brushed it—three years since glass cut that deep, but his touch makes it ache like a fresh wound. The vendor list lies between us on stone still sticky with last night's wine, and his eyes are calculating odds I don't want to know.\n\n\"Caterer won't hold the menu without both our signatures.\" His fingers tap the paper's edge. \"Today.\"\n\nHis borrowed T-shirt hangs empty on the chair back, fabric holding the ghost of his shoulders, and something sharp twists behind my ribs. The cotton is wrinkled where he slept against it, creased in patterns that speak of restless hours. I force myself to look away before the intimacy of it becomes too much to bear.\n\nSofia materializes in the chair opposite, folding herself with predatory grace. My hair catches the morning light, still perfect despite the early hour, and I wonder if she practices that effortless composure in mirrors.\n\nShe places her finger on the seating chart. \"He sits between Dante and Gianna.\" Two deliberate taps. Her eyes find mine through dark lashes. \"Trust me.\"\n\nThe seating chart spreads between us, marked with old trenches, names positioned with military precision. I trace the arrangement with my eyes, noting the careful distances, the strategic placements. Sofia's planning extends beyond table linens and flower arrangements—she's orchestrating something deeper, more complex.\n\nI pressed my temple and turned the glass slowly.\n\nI glance at Marco. His borrowed T-shirt hangs on the chair back, fabric still holding the shape of his shoulders, and something twists behind my ribs. The morning sun catches the fine hair on his forearms as he reaches for his espresso, and I remember how those arms felt around me in the darkness above the chapel.\n\nThe urgency in his voice carries undertones I don't want to examine. There's something desperate beneath the logistics, something that makes my chest tighten with recognition. He needs this wedding to happen, needs it with an intensity that has nothing to do with love and everything to do with survival.\n\nI start to speak, then catch myself. \"Who's going to—\" The words die because saying 'I will' aloud feels dangerous in a monastery courtyard where promises bounce off stone, and if I sign those papers, I'll be bound to this charade until death do us part or his secrets destroy us both.\n\nThe practical details crowd my mind like armor against the emotional minefield spreading across the breakfast table. My shoes are sensible flats, broken in and reliable. My bag contains backup pens and emergency supplies. I am prepared for bureaucracy, if not for the way Marco's fingers drum against his thigh in a rhythm that matches my accelerating pulse.\n\nDante appears with a tray of pastries that smell like butter and orange blossom. He sets it down with theatrical flourish, his movements loose and easy in contrast to the something electric passes between us between the rest of us.\n\n\"Anyone need backup for the bureaucracy run?\" He grins, stealing a piece of Sofia's croissant.\n\nThe pastries glisten with sugar crystals that catch the light like scattered diamonds. Steam rises from their golden surfaces, carrying the scent of citrus and vanilla. My stomach clenches with hunger I've been ignoring since dawn, but reaching for food feels like admitting weakness.\n\nSofia laughs, bright and calculated. She slides the vendor list closer to me, fingertips lingering on the paper's edge.\n\n\"Lena's got this.\" Her voice carries absolute certainty. \"Don't you, honey?\"\n\nHer confidence in my competence feels both flattering and manipulative. She knows I'll handle the paperwork because I always handle the details others avoid. It's my role in this strange dance we're performing—the reliable one, the one who makes things work while others make grand gestures.\n\nMarco reaches across when wind lifts the paper; his fingers brush the scar on my palm where glass cut deep three years ago. The contact sends electricity up my arm, and I see recognition flicker in his eyes—he remembers the accident, remembers holding my bleeding hand while we waited for the ambulance. He pulls his hand back quickly, but the damage is done.\n\n\"Office has everything we need.\" His voice rougher now, like sandpaper.\n\nThe scar tingles where he touched it, a phantom pain that has nothing to do with old wounds and everything to do with the way he's looking at me now. Like he's seeing past the careful walls I've constructed, past the practical exterior to something more vulnerable underneath.\n\nI fold the list into my bag next to my backup pen. \"Right. I'll—\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Marco's interruption cuts sharp through the morning air. His elbow finds the sticky wine stain as he leans forward, drawing out each word like he's explaining contract terms. \"Ledger key's on the sacristan's table. Under the wooden rosary box.\"\n\nHis knowledge of the monastery's inner workings surprises me. He's been here less than a week, but he speaks with the familiarity of someone who's mapped every corner, catalogued every hiding place. I wonder what else he's discovered in his nocturnal wanderings.\n\nSofia claps once, sharp as a judge's gavel.\n\n\"Perfect.\" She waves my hand in dismissal. \"Grab us some real coffee on your way back?\"\n\nHer dismissal stings more than it should. I'm being sent on an errand while the real players remain at the table, and we all know it. But I need the escape, need the breathing room that distance will provide.\n\nThe cicadas resume their racket, their song rising and falling like waves against the cliffs. A gull shrieks over the water, its cry sharp and desperate. I stand and the chair protests with a rusty squeak that echoes off the stone walls. My cup leaves a coffee ring on the table that mirrors his—two perfect circles intersecting at the edges, overlapping in ways that feel too symbolic to ignore.\n\nTwenty minutes later, I find myself in the village bar ordering espresso. The practical details crowd my mind like armor against the emotional minefield spreading across the breakfast table. My shoes are sensible flats, broken in and reliable. My bag contains backup pens and emergency supplies. I am prepared for bureaucracy, if not for the way Marco's fingers drum against his thigh in a rhythm that matches my accelerating pulse.\n\nAfter collecting the coffee, I make my way back to the office. I head for the narrow stairs that lead down to the office and whatever paperwork waits there, my footsteps echoing in the morning stillness like a countdown to something I'm not ready to face.",

      "content": "Lena found herself in the Monastery records room / small wedding office beneath the chapel. A battered manila folder slides off the top of a leaning stack and strikes my shin. I catch it with one hand and peel it open; the return stamp is black and blunt: Castillo & Castillo, Family Law — New York. My signature curls across the service acknowledgment inside, the ink still tacky, and a cheap supermarket sticker with 1,29€ clings to the desk edge like an accusation.\n\nHe reads it over my shoulder before I can slide the folder back into the pile. His thumb rests on the clerk's scrawl. The fluorescent bulb above us hums a different pitch than the one in my apartment—higher, more insistent.\n\n\"That's your stamp.\"\n\nHe flips to the page where a case number matches the ledger Dante once pointed at: NY‑08‑1152 — Vitale. The muscle in his cheek jumps.\n\n\"Luca kept the case numbers. This is about them.\"\n\nI touch the service receipt, tapping the official stamp. My fingers pause on the embossed seal.\n\n\"It was a motion. Procedural—\"\n\n\"You represented their interests.\" He doesn't look up from the file. \"Did what any attorney would do.\"\n\nI scrub at a spot of dried passata on the ledger's corner with the pad of my thumb. The stain doesn't budge.\n\n\"You think I enjoy this? Dios, Marco—we should focus on the wedding.\"\n\nHe doesn't let me change the subject. He lays the folder flat and presses each page like he's trying to make the paper confess.\n\n\"You make a living off people breaking apart.\"\n\nThe accusation lands heavy, impossible to ignore. His hands are steady on the edge of the file; I see the knuckle where a scar catches the light, the way his sleeve has frayed at the cuff, the exact distance he keeps between us when he wants to be deliberate.\n\n\"You chose this.\"\n\nI slide the stamped envelope toward him because evidence is the language I speak when emotions threaten to corrupt the record. My hand trembles.\n\n\"Every case has context.\" The words come out clipped, professional. \"Hospital bills, custody arrangements that were already—\"\n\n\"That's what you keep saying.\" He leans back against the metal filing cabinet. The cabinet groans. His voice is carefully neutral, but I hear the weight underneath. \"To you it's a job.\"\n\nHe stops. Runs a thumb along his jaw.\n\n\"To them it was their family.\"\n\nI reach for the folder, then pull my hand back, tucking it against my ribs.\n\n\"Marco—\"\n\n\"You pick a profession that profits off divorce, then act surprised when people think you're—\"\n\n\"Wait.\" I don't let him finish. \"You think I wanted...\"\n\nHe turns away before I can make a better argument, before I can show him the line item that explains the hospital bills and the custody swap and why I took that case. The door clicks behind him.\n\nThe the quiet lengthens between the filing cabinets like a held breath.\n\nI sit with the folder open in my lap. The citron oil smell from the terrace drifts down through the cracked tiles. The fluorescent hum steadies. My fingers find the edge of the service acknowledgment again and trace my own signature—as if the ink could somehow rewrite history instead of just recording it, as if the careful loops and crosses could undo what they've already witnessed. The filing cabinet's drawer hangs ajar, a dead wasp curled where someone shoved papers and forgot to close the world properly. I close the folder.",

      "content": "Lena found herself walking the path from the office door toward the jasmine grove, the route winding between terraces in the late afternoon light slipping toward golden hour, a journey that would end in Sofia's suite overlooking the sea. I lock the office door and the ring drags across the wood like a verdict. The big iron key chills my palm; the monastery crest on the plastic fob is cracked and half the price sticker still clings, sticky and yellow, a tacky souvenir nobody bothered to peel clean. Enzo's screwdriver rasps from a hallway shaft where he hunches over a hinge that shrieks every time he tests it. I rattle the keys once, twice, naming each in my head like an oath—archive, chapel, cellar—then tuck the ring under my thumb until it presses like a small blade. I step toward the terraces, careful not to smear the sticky tag across my skirt.\n\nThey've gathered where the pergola shadows lace the banqueting table: Gianna with her hands folded so tight they blanch at the knuckles, two vendors with clipboards whose breath carries espresso and cigarette smoke, Dante fiddling with a napkin fold like it's an argument he can win by smoothing. A woman from the linens company pinches the corner of a tablecloth. The morning air carries the scent of jasmine and something sharper—cleaning solution from the kitchen where someone's been scrubbing down surfaces since dawn.\n\n\"The hem's crooked.\" My voice cuts through the morning heat.\n\nGianna's mouth thins. She smooths the fabric with one precise finger, her wedding ring catching the light. \"This will not do.\"\n\nMarco appears beside me, so close I feel the sun-warmed cotton of his shirt. His elbow nudges mine, and I catch the faint smell of his cologne mixed with something else—anxiety, maybe, or the lingering trace of whatever he had for breakfast.\n\n\"Lena—\" He pauses, glances at the vendors. \"Five minutes?\"\n\nI smile and step back half a pace, the distance deliberate. The stone beneath my feet is uneven, worn smooth by decades of footsteps. I hand Gianna the vendor list, my fingers steady. \"Everything's handled.\"\n\nMarco reaches for my elbow; the gesture isn't theatrical, it's a question. His fingers are warm against my skin, callused at the tips from guitar strings. \"What happened back there?\" His voice drops. \"In the office.\"\n\nI pull my arm back, my fingers finding the stone balustrade and rubbing a seam where the mortar flakes, the grit like sand under my nails. The Mediterranean stretches beyond the terrace, its surface broken by the wake of a distant fishing boat. \"The arrangements need adjusting.\" I turn toward the vendor with the clipboard.\n\nEnzo's screwdriver clicks, a small dry sound that draws a line between private and public. The vendor shifts his weight from one foot to the other, checking his watch. Marco runs a knuckles against the railing, the gesture leaving it ruffled.\n\n\"Bella.\" He steps closer. \"Don't do this.\"\n\nI hand the groom's mother a folded copy of the seating chart, edges crisp, ink unblotted. When Gianna smooths it she doesn't look at me, her attention fixed on the arrangement of names like she's solving a puzzle. \"Do what?\" The words come out flat.\n\nSofia finds me later in her suite because her timing is surgical. The suite smells of bergamot and laundry, but there's a coffee ring staining the embroidered throw where someone left a takeout cup; a laminated vendor receipt is stuck half under a coaster, the receipt's total scribbled in handwriting that isn't mine. The afternoon light streams through the windows, casting long shadows across the marble floor. Sofia adjusts her glasses, the gesture sharp.\n\n\"You're avoiding him.\" She sets down her phone. \"Marco.\"\n\nI set my palm flat against the terrace door, feeling the cool metal of the latch and the vibration of the wind against the glass. Through the window, I can see the grapefruit groves stretching toward the coast, their leaves rustling in the breeze. I straighten the vendor receipt with two fingers, aligning its edges with the coaster's rim. \"I'm working.\"\n\nSofia's face hardens. She leans forward, her voice losing its sweetness. The cushions on her chair compress under her weight, the fabric whispering against itself. \"Bullshit.\" A pause. \"This is about the other night, isn't it?\"\n\nShe reaches for my hand, her fingers soft but insistent. The wedding ring on her finger is different from Marco's—older, more ornate, with tiny diamonds that catch the light. \"Whatever you're afraid—\"\n\n\"I won't mess this up for you.\" If I let myself feel anything for him again, I'll lose the only family I have left.\n\nThe words hang between us, obscuring what we mean. Sofia's grip tightens, and I see something flicker across her face—recognition, maybe, or the first crack in whatever plan she's been building. I pull my hand free and move toward the door, my footsteps muffled by the thick Persian rug that covers most of the suite's floor.\n\n\"Lena.\" Her voice stops me at the threshold. I turn back, my hand still on the door handle, and she's watching me with an expression I can't read. \"What happened three years ago?\"\n\nMy throat closes. The question hangs in the space between us, heavy with everything I've never said. Through the window, I can hear the distant sound of Marco's voice calling instructions to someone in the courtyard below. I open my mouth, then close it again, the truth burning behind my teeth like a shard of glass I can't swallow.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Lena's workspace at the monastery—a fold-out desk with a view of the sea, laptop warm to the touch.. The kettle's scream cuts through my apartment like a smoke alarm, but I can't move from this chair. My thumb hovers over the trackpad, frozen, while the signature stares back at me from the screen—L. Castillo, counsel—blurred where someone's scanner devoured the texture but sharp enough to damn me. My pulse hammers against my throat.\n\n\"No.\" I say it out loud because the room needs to hear someone disagree with this.\n\nI need air, space to think beyond these four walls. My fingers slip on the keyboard. I tuck a lock off my shoulder and taste salt—from the air or my skin, I can't tell. The decree's a service acknowledgment with dates and a case number I shoved into a filing box three years ago, its tab bent where I pressed too hard trying to make it disappear. Someone scanned this from paper that lived in a drawer too long. The chapel's stamp bleeds over the edge like watercolor on wet paper.\n\nI read for ammunition: parties, filing date, signature line. Parse what can be weaponized, what gets ignored by someone hunting for scandal. The document quality tells a story—whoever pulled this knew exactly which filing cabinet to check, which folder held the smoking gun. This wasn't random discovery. Someone went hunting.\n\nThe laptop screen flickers, and I slam my palm against the desk to steady it.\n\nSofia's heels click against stone outside my door. \"Lena, are you in there?\"\n\nHer voice carries that thread of panic she gets when a zipper breaks ten minutes before an event. Behind her, a wardrobe door slams like punctuation.\n\nI minimize the window. \"Just work emails.\"\n\nA pause. The doorknob turns slowly. \"Can I come in?\"\n\nMy phone lights up—Marco's name with a voicemail bubble waiting like bad news. I press it to my ear and his voice slides through, low with salt around the edges. \"Bella, listen.\"\n\nThe old lightness threaded with something careful. Static, then: \"We should talk tonight.\"\n\nI play it again because tone matters when you're parsing what silence wants. He doesn't demand. Leaves me to decide whether to show up where truth gets cross-examined. The background noise sounds like the harbor—wind through rigging, water against hulls. He's down at the marina, probably sitting on his boat with a cigarette and whatever he's decided I need to hear.\n\nMy jaw clenches tight as I grip the edge of the table.\n\nI thumb out Not tonight, then delete it.\n\nThe reply writes itself like a brief: clinical, bulletproof. \"Attached is a scanned decree recording service acknowledgment dated [date], bearing my signature as counsel of record for petitioner. Document is public court filing, not private communication.\" My fingers move cleaner than my thoughts. I skip the three sentences that would explain why this signature matters to anyone besides me and some clerk who folded it wrong. The cursor blinks like a judge's gavel waiting.\n\nI add case numbers and an offer for certified copies if needed. The legal language feels like armor—each phrase a shield between me and whatever storm this document is meant to unleash. But armor weighs heavy, and my shoulders already ache from carrying secrets that multiply like compound interest.\n\nI rotate my ring slowly, the metal warm against my skin.\n\nThe laptop's left a warm ring on the desk that smells like the sunscreen I smeared on this morning and forgot to wash off—coconut and zinc oxide, domestic and stupid and nothing like the dignity of legal language. But it anchors me: I'm not in Manhattan anymore. Here, documents can't chase me through marble lobbies or corner me in conference rooms that smell like fear and expensive coffee.\n\nI delete the phrase that edges toward apology, replace it with \"Available to discuss logistics with you and Dante's counsel.\" Hit send. The whoosh cuts through the room like an envelope sliding under a door.\n\nThe kettle's scream finally penetrates my focus. I push back from the desk, chair legs scraping against stone, and pad barefoot to the kitchen. The floor tiles are cold enough to make me hiss through my teeth. I turn off the burner and pour water over tea leaves that smell like bergamot and better decisions.\n\nSofia pushes in, cheeks flushed from whatever dress emergency she's been managing. Her heels tap against stone as she crosses to me. She stops at my shoulder, studying my face with the intensity she usually reserves for seating charts and vendor contracts.\n\n\"You sent him something.\" She adjusts her glasses, a tell I know too well. \"What kind of something?\"\n\nI snap the laptop shut. The sound echoes off stone walls like a book closing on a story I'm not ready to finish.\n\n\"The kind that's already public record.\" I wrap my fingers around the warm mug, using the heat to steady my hands. \"Someone dug up the divorce decree. From the Henderson case.\"\n\nSofia's face goes carefully blank. \"The one where—\"\n\n\"Where I met Marco. Yes.\" The words taste like copper pennies. \"Someone knows we were opposing counsel. Someone knows about that night.\"\n\nShe sinks into the chair across from me, her wedding planning binder forgotten on the counter. \"Honey, that was three years ago. Ancient history.\"\n\n\"Tell that to whoever's playing archaeologist with court records.\" I take a sip of tea and burn my tongue. \"Cazzo. Sorry. I meant—\"\n\n\"You've been hanging around Marco too long.\" Sofia's mouth twitches despite everything. \"What did you tell him?\"\n\n\"Nothing he can't get from the clerk's office himself.\" I set down the mug harder than necessary. \"I'm not apologizing for doing my job.\"\n\n\"That's not what I asked.\" She reaches across the table, my fingers cool against my wrist. \"What did you tell him?\"\n\nThe question sits between us, undeniable neither of us wants to examine. I pull my hand back and tuck another escaped loose hair from my temple.\n\n\"That we can discuss logistics. Through counsel.\"\n\n\"Lena.\" Her voice drops to that gentle tone she uses when she's about to say something I won't want to hear. \"You can't lawyer your way out of this one.\"\n\n\"I have to try—if this gets out, it won't just destroy my reputation, it'll torpedo Sofia's wedding and give the Vitales everything they need to tear Marco apart in court.\"",

I stoop because being dramatic costs less than apologizing, and because the jar of bitter marmellata—the same cheap glass we shared spoons from after an all-night planning session—teeters at the edge. I slide my fingers under the crate.\n\nMy sandal catches a smear of old frying oil, my foot skids and the crate pitches again. Marco's hand presses against the splintered wood before mine can reach the lid.\n\n\"Attenta.\" His voice sounds like he's speaking to a stranger.\n\nI look up at him. He has flecks of flour on his knuckles from yesterday's focaccia delivery; sunlight catches the silver threading his temple.\n\n\"Hey.\" The word escapes before I can stop it.

His hand slides from the wood and he straightens, taking the shopping basket dangling from his wrist.\n\n\"I need to—\" The words drop between us, weighted and silent. He doesn't ask me to step away. He steps away. Around us a child laughs because someone has dropped a bergamot into an upturned pan and the noise sounds like applause.\n\nI fumble for the marmellata and my thumb finds the label's cheap sticker, half-lifted so it peels like an old promise.\n\n\"Do you remember—\" My voice cracks. \"Those jars we used to—after the seating charts?\"\n\nHe shifts his basket to the other arm, the motion deliberate. His jaw works like he's chewing something bitter.\n\nHours later, the sun climbs higher and the market empties. \"Fish market closes at noon.\"\n\nThe jar slips in my sweaty palm and I clutch it against my chest, the cool glass pressing into my ribs.\n\n\"That's not—\"\n\n\"Not here.\" Something flickers across his face, gone before I can name it.\n\nHe starts walking along the quay, basket swinging, each step a deliberate stitch between us. The market swells around him—an old man arguing over fish, a gelato cart's cheap speaker sputtering karaoke, a woman tying a child's shoelace with hands that look like maps—and he moves through it all the way a man moves through a life he is trying to make smaller. He knows if he stays another moment, he'll say something that will make this hurt worse for both of us.\n\nA seagull swoops low, its wing brushing my shoulder as it dives for a dropped piece of bread near my feet.\n\nI want to catalog his expression: the set of his jaw, the way his shoulders slope. I blink.\n\n\"Marco—\"\n\nHe doesn't stop. Someone's dog sniffs a honeysuckle and sneezes loudly; a vendor curses and bends to gather the fruit, his palms yellowed from the rind. I hold the jar like evidence, fingers pressed into the curve of glass, knowing that if I let him disappear into the crowd now, I'll lose my last chance to save what we built together before Sofia's wedding tears it apart completely. The marmellata smells faintly of burnt peel and sugar that didn't quite caramelize, and the sticker clings to my thumbnail when I try to set it down.\n\nThe crowd reclaims its rhythm and I stand with the jar caught between wanting to stomp after him and wanting to put it on the table and make nothing of it. I press my lips together—just once—and the motion feels absurd and necessary both.\n\n\"Wait.\" The word is too small, too public, swallowed by the slap of a fisherman's net hitting wood.\n\nHe is already half a street away, a rectangle of navy moving into a crease of sunlight, and I'm left holding cheap glass that smells like citrus and regret.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the A stone bench beneath the lime groves behind the monastery, dusk and the first insects humming.. Enzo pushes a chipped bottle toward me with a thumb that reeks of fried garlic. \"I'm not here to make you feel better.\" He tips the bottle. Syrup-bright liquid slides into the tiny glass. The bench where we sit has a dark Vespa tire mark slashed across the old stone like graffiti on a cathedral. A moth clings to the crack near my knee, wings twitching when I set the glass down.\n\nHe taps the rim with his knuckle, then drops the little iron key into my palm. The metal is heavier than it looks, pitted with rust that lost the war. \"Gianna's got the copy.\" His breath smells like espresso and the jasmine liqueur. Insects buzz in the olive branches overhead like static. He folds his hands. A thin scar runs across his left knuckle. \"She's planning to show Sofia at breakfast.\"\n\nI stare at the key. \"Tomorrow they pick sides. Better to pick first.\"\n\n\"No.\" The word cracks out like I'm objecting to evidence. I close my fingers around the key. The metal catches on the callus I've built from gripping pens during depositions. The limoncello tastes like candied peel and bad decisions. Enzo watches me like he's waiting for a verdict. Jasmine drifts through the courtyard mixed with something medicinal from the herb garden. \"How did she—\"\n\n\"Found a printout.\" Enzo drums his fingers on the bench. A train groans somewhere inland, making the lime leaves shiver. \"Copy, not original.\"\n\nI lean forward. \"What kind of copy?\"\n\n\"Someone left files out in the venue office last week.\" He studies my face like he expects me to cite procedure instead of panic. \"When you went for those lists. Helper snapped photos before anyone caught on.\"\n\nThe key presses into my palm. A small scar on my left hand twitches. The limoncello leaves sticky residue on my lips. \"Doesn't need originals.\"\n\n\"Esatto.\" His mouth twists. \"She's got enough to ruin breakfast.\"\n\nI count my options: confess to Sofia tonight and hope loyalty buys time; confront Gianna and risk a fight that wrecks everything before the vows; prepare a public explanation and pray narrative control works. The key bites into my palm. Waves crash against rocks below, almost drowning them.\n\n\"I need more time.\" The words come out smaller than I meant.\n\nEnzo tilts his head with the patience of someone who's watched this movie before. \"Time's already gone.\"\n\n\"She'll wait until—\"\n\n\"She won't.\" His voice carries courthouse finality. \"Wants Sofia alone, quiet, before the family catches wind.\" He taps the glass. The sound cuts sharp against stone. \"Let her tell the story first, you'll be playing defense for weeks.\"\n\nI fold the key into my palm and slip it into my dress pocket. The metal burns warm against my hip through the thin fabric. Light spills golden from Sofia's window across the courtyard. She's probably reading, feet tucked under her in that armchair that barely fits her frame, completely unaware that in twelve hours everything will shatter.\n\nThe key weighs nothing and everything in my pocket. I could walk across these stones right now, knock on her door, and tell her the truth myself. Let her hear it from my lips instead of Gianna's poison.\n\nI pressed my temple and turned the glass slowly.\n\nBut standing here in the jasmine-scented darkness, watching her silhouette move behind the gauze curtains, I realize I'm not ready to watch the love drain from my eyes when she learns what I've done.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Lena's bedside desk with a lamp, the view of thunderclouds gathering over the sea.. The scar on my palm splits open against the lace—not blood, just memory made flesh.\n\nI'm holding Abuela's letter in a storm-dark room above the Mediterranean when the power cuts out, plunging me into blackness so complete I can taste the salt air and hear my own heartbeat hammering against my ribs like it's trying to escape. The lamplight flickers back on, casting wild shadows that make the handwriting dance across the page, and I'm eight years old again, watching my parents' marriage shatter like the wine glass that left this mark on my hand.\n\n\"Mi querida niña,\" I read aloud, the consonants folded in Abuela's slow, sure slant. The scent of citron and dust rises from the paper. The tin sticks to the desk where a tacky ring of limoncello dried and left a stubborn amber stain.\n\nA soft knock interrupts the silence. The door creaks as he leans against it.\n\n\"Lena?\" Marco's voice carries through the wood, rough with something I can't name. \"You vanished after Sofia cut the cake.\"\n\nI close my fingers around the lace, the delicate threads catching on my scar. The neither of us fills the gap until I hear him shift his weight.\n\n\"Just needed some space.\"\n\n\"In a thunderstorm?\" The floorboards creak as he moves closer to the door. Something soft hits the wood—his forehead, maybe. \"I brought you something. That olive bread from lunch—the one you actually smiled eating.\"\n\nThe kindness in that simple gesture makes my throat close. I press my back against the chair, creating distance from his voice.\n\n\"You don't have to—\"\n\n\"The power's been cutting in and out downstairs.\" His words come faster now, like he's afraid I'll stop listening. \"There are candles in the kitchen if this lamp dies on you.\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Marco.\"\n\nSilence. Then his footsteps, slow and deliberate, moving away from my door. They pause at the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Lena?\" His voice is quieter now, almost lost under the thunder. \"Whatever you're thinking in there... just remember you don't have to figure it all out tonight.\"\n\nI hear him walk down the hallway toward the stairs.\n\nThe first line is both benediction and summons. Memory arrives. Evidence produced, testimony taken, conclusion pending. The hush of my parents' arguments surfaces in sharp, useful little facts—plates impacting like gavel hits, my father's footsteps on the stairs counted down like a docket, my mother crying into the cuff of a dress until the fabric reeked of vinegar and talc. The scar on my left palm remembers the glass that split the night everything altered. Years of depositions and custody pleadings hardened my voice into an That's not the question. I learned to say \"sustained\" before I allowed myself to believe there could be gentler verdicts. I went to law school with that yellowing letter folded tight in my pocket like a warrant.\n\nI undo the hem because the note demands to be read in full. The lace sifts through my fingers releasing tiny dust motes that dance in the lamplight. Before I speak the words aloud, I trace them with my eyes—Abuela's warning about pity, about dignity, her understanding of something fundamental about the women in our family and the choices we make when we're afraid. \"No te cases por lástima,\" I read, tasting the words the way you test salt on a thumb. Abuela's script leans left as if she were writing against a wind. \"Abuela,\" I murmur, and my voice catches on the moth-eaten stitch. The cheap sticker on the tin's rim still reads \"€12\" and the absurdity of a price tag on a family relic makes me smile without humor.\n\nAnother knock, lighter this time. The floorboards groan under shifting weight.\n\n\"Signorina?\" Signora Benedetti's voice wavers through the door. \"The lights downstairs—they keep going dark. You have enough light up there?\"\n\nI press my palm against the cool wood. \"Sí, I have the lamp.\"\n\n\"Bene, bene.\" I can practically see her wringing her hands. \"But this storm tonight—she's angry. Makes too much noise for a young woman alone.\"\n\nThe maternal worry in my voice reminds me of all the women who tried to fill the spaces my mother left empty. \"I'm used to storms, Signora.\"\n\n\"Ah, but this one...\" Her voice drops to a whisper, like she's sharing a secret. \"Your nonna wrote to me once, you know. Said the women in your family, they have strong hearts. But even strong hearts need company when the thunder shakes the walls.\"\n\nI lean my forehead against the door. Strong like Abuela. If only she knew how close I am to becoming exactly what I swore I'd never be.\n\n\"Maybe... maybe in the morning we talk, sí? About your nonna's letters.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Sleep well, cara mia. The storm will pass.\"\n\nHours later, I'm back at the hotel balcony. That line rearranges the past into cause and effect. The places where I hardened come into focus: the metal filing cabinet that reeked of toner and half-drunk coffee, the stack of divorce decrees I kept like small, legal amulets, the case that made me sleep in a conference room because a child's bleeding lungs displaced everything else. I hear Marco's steady hands in that memory—the hotel balcony where he calmed me after the hospital call. The memory is precise enough to be inconvenient. He said \"bene\" and then passed me a cigarette like an offer of truce. \"Dios,\" I whisper, Spanish sharpening into arithmetic when emotion threatens to misfile itself. I press the stitch flat with the pad of my thumb where my scar sits.\n\nI read the rest because Abuela never leaves an instruction without a footprint and the paper contains a second sentence folded twice. \"Si no puedes luchar por amor, lucha por tu dignidad,\" I read aloud, the phrase landing like a verdict. \"Ay, per favore,\" I say, because old women distill complex ethics into recipes—measure, stir, taste. Permission. Abuela is giving me ingredient-level permission to choose. Moth dust flakes off between my fingers and tastes faintly of lavender that has lingered too long.\n\nI fold the letter back into its careful creases and stand, my bare feet finding the cool floor. Tomorrow I'll have to choose between Marco's kindness and my own survival.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Narrow north-facing balcony of the monastery, wind, rain, the sea thundering below.. Thunder cracked and I pushed the balcony door wide enough for rain to nick the hem of my dress. I set the clay pot back on the stone balustrade, fingers damp where the glaze pooled, and smoothed the torn pharmacy receipt that had stuck to the threshold—€2.50, half the letters smeared. My mouth tasted of seawater and grapefruit rind from dinner I hadn't touched. The Italian words I'd been rehearsing all evening crumbled before I could speak them.\n\nA knock banged so hard the bougainvillea shivered.\n\nThe pot rocked and I caught it with one hand, heel of my palm pressing the small scar I keep to remind me of other breaks. Sofia's voice came muffled through the shutters, too high, pitched with worry. I opened the balcony door and rain sprayed my calves; she stumbled inside like she was fleeing something she couldn't name, coat dripping onto my rug, hair plastered to her cheekbone, perfume gone sharp with the diesel smell of the ferry in the harbor.\n\nWater tracked across the floor in muddy crescents where her boots left prints. I grabbed the towel from my desk chair, but she waved it away, shaking droplets from her sleeves that caught the lamplight like scattered glass. The storm had turned her careful composure inside out—mascara smudged beneath one eye, the silk scarf she'd worn at dinner now twisted around my throat like a tourniquet.\n\nShe snatched the receipt from the stone, waving it like evidence.\n\n\"Marco called Dante.\" Her fingers crumpled the paper. \"The caterer's walking.\"\n\nMy throat closed around his name. \"Might walk. There's still—\"\n\n\"Twenty-four hours, Lena.\" Sofia pressed my back against the door. \"He's already calculating damages.\"\n\nThe rehearsed lines scattered like wet paper. \"Qué desastre,\" I muttered, then fumbled into Italian. \"Non è—it's not a scandal, just a—\"\n\n\"Stop.\" Sofia's hands moved to my shoulders. \"I need names. Dates. Anything I can use before he signs with someone else.\"\n\nThe rain drummed harder against the shutters, and somewhere in the monastery's depths a door slammed. I could hear voices echoing off stone walls, fragments of conversation that might have been prayers or arguments. My tongue felt thick with the weight of confession, the words I'd swallowed for three years threatening to choke me.\n\nI abandoned the artful confession I'd practiced—measured, like a deposition—and let the truth spill rough.\n\n\"Three years ago.\" I swallowed hard. \"Custody case. Connected to Dante's family.\"\n\nSofia's nails bit through my dress. \"You've been hiding this for three years?\"\n\n\"I thought I could contain it.\" The cold air burned my lungs. \"I have the file. I kept it to—to fix things.\"\n\n\"You don't fix anything by hiding it.\" Her voice went deadly quiet. \"File details. Now.\"\n\nMy laptop sat open on the bed, screen dark but still warm from hours of staring at legal documents. The cursor had blinked over the same email draft for two hours before Sofia arrived—subject line empty, body filled with half-formed explanations that dissolved before I could send them. I pulled up the scanned documents, pages that had lived in my desk drawer like a tumor I couldn't excise.\n\nThe laptop screen flickered to life, casting blue light across Sofia's face as she leaned closer.\n\nDown the hall someone's television murmured through thin walls, canned laughter bleeding through the monastery's ancient stone. I rattled off what she needed: names, dates, the redacted case number.\n\n\"I emailed myself a copy,\" I said, my Italian collapsing into fragments. \"The scans are—\"\n\nShe smoothed the damp receipt, studying my handwriting like evidence. The pharmacy logo had bled into an abstract smear, but my notes remained stubbornly legible—timing, damage control, the careful architecture of lies I'd built around this moment. The paper felt fragile between my fingers, ready to dissolve.\n\nDown the corridor a voice cut through the rain—low, precise, accusatory.\n\n\"She had the file the whole time, Dante.\" Each word landed like a physical blow. \"I don't trust her.\"\n\nMarco's voice. That particular tone he used when delivering verdicts. Sofia went pale in the lamplight, and I watched her calculate the distance between this room and the main corridor, the impossibility of escape.\n\nI planted my feet against the cold stone floor, toes gripping through my shoes. The ancient stones felt solid and unforgiving beneath me, and I pressed my weight into them like an anchor.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Monastery hallway by Enzo's small doorway, lantern light and the smell of rain on stone.. A soft knock, patient and small, rapped against my door and a man's voice threaded through the slot: \"Sei pronta?\" I pressed the tip of my thumb into the damp envelope on the desk and felt the paper give. Lantern oil warmed the hall with honeyed light; rain made the flagstones smell sharp and old; a dead moth hung against the lantern glass, wings curled like tiny parentheses. I folded the corner of the note over once more—one precise crease.\n\nI cracked the door. Enzo filled the doorway, his palms rough like an old mechanic's, holding a folded scrap of brass—a tiny key with a bent tooth. He waited, patient as stone, while I wrestled with the words.\n\n\"How do I—\" I tugged at an escaped curl. \"Voglio... essere onesta?\"\n\nThe syllables felt foreign, like testing hostile witness credibility. He nodded once, encouraging.\n\n\"Voglio essere onesta.\" I repeated it slower this time, and the vowels landed somewhere closer to right.\n\nMy hands shook. I smudged ink on the top of the paper where I wrote the butchered phrase, then folded the note the way Abuela folded love letters and fines—left corner to center, right corner over it, bottom up, then the top tucked in so the paper becomes a small, private envelope. I slid the little brass key into the seam and let it fall against the inked words. The fold made a neat, almost clerical square.\n\nI pressed my temple, feeling the pulse beneath my fingertips.\n\nEnzo shifted his weight; the lantern light carved a new shadow across his cheek.\n\n\"Lo consegno domani mattina.\" His voice carried the weight of logistics, of plans made and kept.\n\nMy fingers tightened around the note. \"What time exactly? Before he wakes up, or—\"\n\n\"When it's safe.\" He held up a hand, cutting me off gently but firmly.\n\nI handed him a damp twenty-euro note; its corners stuck to my fingers. \"Mettilo sul suo cuscino?\"\n\nThe command came out mangled, but he understood. He tucked the bill into his shirt pocket.\n\n\"Sì.\"\n\nHe paused, studying my face with those careful eyes. \"E per colazione?\"\n\n\"What if he's already awake?\" The question came out sharper than I intended.\n\n\"Then I wait.\"\n\nHis answer came too quickly, too rehearsed. Something in his tone made me narrow my eyes. Too practiced. Too smooth.\n\n\"You've done this before.\"\n\nHe peered at me with a small, conspiratorial smile but said nothing. The seconds stack up without words between us like a held breath.\n\n\"Io parlerò al ricevimento. Poi lo cerco.\" The words came quieter now, like a confession in chambers.\n\n\"Sei sicura?\"\n\nI hooked my fingers through the thin linen bag on my shoulder where Abuela's lace peeked out and thought of the file, the accusation, Dante's steady face, Gianna's careful silence, Marco's guilt.\n\n\"Sì.\" I paused, then added with a rueful smile, \"Fair enough.\"\n\nA door slammed somewhere in the corridor, followed by hurried footsteps on stone. The sound jarred me back to reality, reminding me that even in life my instincts flee to the courtroom.\n\nI handed him the folded square—note wrapped around the key, the Italian scrawl visible on the top. He smelled of orange zest peel and espresso, a scent that pulled my brain back to the morning when he fixed the coffee machine after we'd argued about seatings. He tucked the note into a pocket and folded the twenty into his hand like an accountant verifying payment, then cocked his head.\n\n\"Buona fortuna, avvocata.\"\n\n\"Gracias.\" It slipped out automatic, lighter than I wanted.\n\nHe stepped out into the wet corridor, but then stopped. Turned back. His hand found the doorframe, and for a moment he just looked at me—really glared, like he was memorizing something.\n\n\"What you wrote in that note.\" His voice dropped to barely above a whisper. \"You meant it?\"\n\nMy throat went dry. The words I'd scrawled in broken Italian felt exposed now, dangerous. \"I don't—\" I wanted to lie, to deflect, to cross-examine my way out of the truth. But something in his eyes made me strip away every defense I'd ever built, the same defenses that had kept me safe while I dissected other people's broken hearts for profit.\n\n\"Yes.\" The word came out raw, unguarded. \"Every word.\"\n\nHe stepped closer, inches away, and I could feel the warmth radiating from his skin. His fingers brushed against mine where they gripped the doorframe, and I forgot how to breathe. \"Then you should know,\" he said, \"you\\'re braver than you think.\"\n\nThe words hung between us, unfinished, heavy with possibility.",

My mouth tasted like cotton and panic as I stared at the spreading stain that threatened to destroy everything I'd planned to say.\n\n\"Sofia taught me that love can be defended.\" The sentence came out strangled. The handkerchief pinned to my notes smelled of lavender and the musty corners of Abuela's cedar chest.\n\nI tugged at a loose curl and swore in Spanish. \"Dios mío.\"\n\nEnzo cleared his throat from the bergamot tree's shade and set a chipped espresso cup on the table. A faded COOP sticker clung to its rim. He wiped his hands on his apron, leaving streaks of flour that caught the morning light like chalk dust.\n\n\"Easy now.\" His Italian accent softened the edges of the words. The way he said it reminded me of how my father used to calm my mother during thunderstorms, that particular gentleness men reserve for moments when they recognize genuine fear.\n\nI tried again, louder this time, forcing the cadence to match the slow tolling beyond the terrace. \"I've worked cases where names destroyed what was precious. I'm not here to reopen wounds, only to—\" The sentence stretched and dissolved. I pressed the handkerchief harder with my thumb and felt a thread snag. The fabric was thinner than I remembered, worn soft by decades of Abuela's careful washing. A neighbor's frying pan clattered from the courtyard below, followed by the sharp sizzle of oil meeting onions.\n\nEnzo tapped the page with a floury fingertip. His fingers left a pale oval on my notes, and I watched him study the bleeding ink where my pen had snagged on the lace edge. \"Too many words.\"\n\nThe espresso cup sat between us like a small offering, steam rising in delicate spirals that dissolved before reaching the honeysuckle branches overhead. I could smell the bitter richness of the coffee mixing with the sweet citrus and something else—yeast, maybe, from whatever he'd been kneading in the kitchen before I arrived.\n\nI handed him a list written in my cramped script: distract with antipasti, keep Dante near the olive oil tasting, let Sofia usher Gianna to the chapel alcove when the cake comes out. He took the paper, scanning my handwriting. \"If Nonna asks about the file, send her to the kitchen.\"\n\nEnzo folded the paper along the crease of his thumb, and how his hands moved with the same deliberate care he'd shown when arranging the table settings yesterday. The paper made a soft whisper as he creased it. \"Sì. I make the distractions.\" He rose and his shoes scraped against worn stone, the sound echoing off the terrace walls like scattered percussion.\n\nOn the terrace a smear of orange marmalade had dried under the teapot spout, tacky against the sun. The sight of it made my stomach clench—such a small, domestic detail in the middle of what felt like preparing for battle. I pressed my palms flat against the table and felt the grain of the wood, rough and sun-warmed, grounding me.\n\n\"Enzo.\" I waited until he turned back. \"What if this changes everything?\"\n\nHe paused, one hand resting on the back of his chair. \"Changes how?\"\n\n\"What if bringing it into the light ruins what they've—\"\n\n\"Some secrets, they poison in the dark.\" He shrugged, a gesture that carry decades of village wisdom. \"Better the light, no?\"\n\nThe words settled over me like a benediction, or maybe an absolution I hadn't known I needed. I folded the handkerchief so Abuela's initials cupped the corner of my note, the embroidered letters soft against my fingertip. \"And if they push back—call me. Don't let them corner you.\"\n\nHe nodded, tucking my list into his apron pocket with the same care he'd shown the paper. \"Subito. Right away.\"\n\nThe bell started its rolling again, one chime after another like a metronome counting my decision into action. Each toll vibrated through the stone beneath my feet, through the table, through my bones. I slid the pages into my dress pocket and put my hand on the safety pin as the third chime vibrated through the terrace, the sound carrying across the village like a summons I could no longer ignore.",

      "content": "\"Why doesn't she tell us now?\" a woman in the third pew snapped, her voice thin with accusation, and heads turned toward me the way witnesses tilt toward a stand in court. I gripped the runner, linen cool against my wrists, my thumb catching a curling strip of scotch tape with a supermarket barcode stuck to the hem—cheap and incongruous, those black lines jarring against the white. The organist froze mid-phrase. Dante glanced at Sofia. Breath moved through the chapel in small, audible rhythms.\n\nI pressed my hand flat to keep the runner from sliding and let the question land where it would. Uncle Paolo, hovering too close to the catering table, flinched and his elbow clipped Enzo's tray. Red wine launched in a low arc and collapsed into a spreading, glossy bruise across the aisle.\n\nSofia's hands flew to her mouth. \"¡Dios mío!\"\n\nHer sentence tumbled out long and quick, already moving—hands at my hips, fingers splayed in damage-control choreography.\n\nI knelt. The linen drank the stain fast. It smelled of tannin and old fruit, sharper than the jasmine groves outside and embarrassingly domestic. Murmurs rose—small, precise blades—and someone near the back said, \"If she's hiding something, why not tell us now?\" as if a wet runner were proof.\n\nThe chapel door slammed shut behind someone leaving, the sound echoing off stone walls like a judge's gavel.\n\nAunt Luisa—thin-lipped, a woman who measures scandal by the decibel—leaned forward. Her voice cut through the whispers like steel.\n\n\"If she won't say it, I will.\"\n\nGianna's face folded like a closed fan. \"Basta.\" The word cracked like a whip. She drew a breath, her voice dropping to something softer but no less final. \"Not here.\"\n\nMarco moved from the side pew with slow steps that glared casual but left no space between him and me. He set his palm against my shoulder—not a lover's claim but a blocking tactic.\n\n\"Hey.\" His thumb pressed against my collarbone. \"Let's not do this now.\"\n\nI straightened, my knees protesting against the stone. \"Hold on.\" I brushed wine-dark drops from my skirt. \"Irrelevant to today's rehearsal.\"\n\nMy voice thinned at the edges, but the chapel paused on the same syllable that the organ had left suspended. Aunt Luisa's mouth tightened. She folded the copy of the decree she had produced as if crumpling a losing hand.\n\n\"They have a right to know.\"\n\nDante put a tentative hand on his mother's elbow. \"Mamma, please.\" His voice carried that particular exhaustion of family peacemakers. \"Let's keep this about the wedding.\"\n\nSofia leaned close enough for her perfume to ghost warm citrus and something floral I couldn't place. She adjusted her glasses, a tell I'd learned to read years ago.\n\n\"Lena, honey.\" Her fingers found my wrist. \"Maybe after the reception? Maybe we could—\"\n\n\"No.\" I looked at Marco. His thumbs rubbed the seam of his palm. \"Do you want me to—\"\n\nHe stopped because he could see my shoulders already squaring to a decision.\n\nI pulled the pages from the pocket of my dress—the ones I had tucked in earlier, Abuela's embroidery pin securing them where no one would suspect—and smoothed them with fingers that had handled subpoenas and coffee cups in equal measure.\n\n\"I'll handle it.\" The paper crinkled between my palms. \"At the reception, before dessert.\"\n\nMarco's hand found mine briefly, not warming, only steadying.\n\nI pressed my temple and gripped the edge of the table.\n\nSofia's mouth softened, satisfied. Gianna watched me with an appraisal that held less mistrust than calculation.\n\nI rose, stepping over the darkening wine, boots whispering on stone, and walked toward the chapel doors with the pages folded tight. The courtyard light hit the runner where the wine bled and threw a thin, stubborn shine across the stain.\n\nGianna's voice followed me, crisp as autumn air. \"Make it quick.\"\n\nThe door was already open when I answered, \"I will.\"",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Service corridor behind the monastery's wine cellar. I push Enzo's spare iron key into the crooked lock and the latch gives with a rusted surrender. The door yawns open onto a corridor that smells of old cork and lime oil, and a supermarket price sticker—€1,99—peels half off a wooden crate at my feet, sticky with something sweet and rotten. The cool stone air pulls me in and there he is, back to me, thumb tracing the edge of a yellowed photograph taped to a beam like a relic. My throat constricts.\n\nI step forward until the toe of my shoe nudges the crate with the price tag, and the scrape sounds vicious in the small space; he doesn't look at me. His sleeve rolls just above the elbow, skin freckled where the sun has been kinder to him than it was to me, and there are faint white ridges at the knuckles—old rope burns maybe—from carrying more than his share of something. He smells of soap and olives and something like smoke that won't quit, which is unfair because scent is not supposed to be persuasive. I clear my throat.\n\n\"Marco.\"\n\nMy voice falls flat; the corridor devours the rest. He shifts his weight but keeps one shoulder angled toward the beam.\n\n\"Lena.\"\n\nHis thumb stills on the photograph. The edges of the paper have gone soft, like something precious handled too often.\n\nMy thumb rubs against my palm as I turn slowly.\n\nBecause he won't turn, I reach for the explanation that lives folded in my dress pocket—Abuela's pin pressing cold metal against the linen—and I slide the pages out, letting the paper breathe so I'm not speaking from memory alone.\n\n\"I need you to hear this. Before—\"\n\n\"Not here.\" His voice cuts through mine. He finally faces me, only partly. One boot on the lower rung of a shelving unit leaves a smear of dust on the stone. \"Not like this.\"\n\n\"You can't just—\" I stop, watching his hand drop from the photograph. The the quiet lengthens until I have to fill it. \"In front of everyone, I mean.\"\n\n\"What exactly do you think this is?\"\n\nHis eyes find mine for the first time since I walked in. There's something raw there, something that makes my prepared words feel small and useless.\n\n\"A conversation. Between us.\" I step closer until the crate's splinter grazes my shin. \"Before it becomes something else.\"\n\n\"Before you make it something else.\"\n\nThe accusation lands like a slap. I swallow the defensive response that wants to spill out.\n\n\"I made a plan—\"\n\n\"Cazzo, Lena.\" He runs both hands through his hair. \"You and your fucking plans.\"\n\nThe long sentence unspools: I tell him about Enzo, about the bell and the metronome of decisions, about the pages that list facts in neat columns instead of gossip torn at the edges, all of which is meant to be a shield for Sofia and Dante and the man in the photograph who isn't here to forgive anyone. I say it quickly because if I slow down the mercy of him walking away will harden into refusal.\n\nThe photograph flutters against the beam in a draft I can't feel, the tape curling at one corner.\n\nI press my temple and cross to the railing.\n\nHe looks at the photograph then, not at me, and his jaw locks.\n\n\"Luca.\"\n\nHe says the name as if laying it on the beam himself would steady it. His shoulders rise with a breath he doesn't release.\n\n\"You think explaining fixes this?\"\n\nSomething in my chest twists at the way his voice breaks on the last word.\n\n\"There's context—\"\n\n\"Context.\" He shakes his head, a bitter sound escaping that might have been laughter. \"Madonna, you really are a lawyer.\"\n\nThe words hit harder than they should. I grip the pages tighter.\n\n\"Please.\"\n\nThe single word hangs between us like incense. He pushes off the beam and steps toward the light at the corridor's mouth where the monastery's white stone gives way to a sliver of bougainvillea color.\n\n\"I won't let you ambush my family.\"\n\nHis voice has gone cold, professional. Like he's talking to a stranger. He doesn't slam the door. He doesn't need to. He leaves it ajar like a question.\n\nI stand with the pages in my hand, the safety pin biting into the palm of my fingers, and the €1,99 sticker glares up at me from the crate like a judge tallying the cheap calculus of compromises. He stops at the threshold and turns back, his face caught between shadow and the chapel light beyond.\n\n\"You want to know what Luca told me? Right before—\" His voice cracks. \"My brother said I should have told you the truth about us...\"\n\nThe pages slip from my fingers. About us. The words echo in the stone corridor like a confession neither of us is ready for.",

My program splits open and the vendor slip tumbles out—stark courier font screaming *legal records* across terracotta stone. My sandal sticks to abandoned limoncello gelato, neon pink and tacky, and somewhere behind me the damage spreads through the crowd like spilled wine.\n\nI shove a piece back from my forehead and clamp my hand over the program, but it's too late.\n\nThe stone thrums under my feet. Priest's words ricochet off the cliff face while sea spray mixes iron and something chemical—fabric softener maybe, from the laundry lines below.\n\nSofia keeps talking, vowels stretched like taffy, and Dante's hands find hers with that steady way he has. Like he's following a recipe instead of winging it.\n\nDante clears his throat, voice carrying over the cliff wind. \"I promise to be the ingredient that keeps our days simmering—not as heat but as warmth.\"\n\nEveryone exhales because they want something to taste afterward when he talks like that. Wind catches my program and flips it wide. The vendor slip tumbles out again—stark courier font screaming *legal records* across the terracotta stone.\n\nMy sandal sticks to something. Limoncello gelato, neon pink and tacky, abandoned by some kid who's probably chasing lizards now.\n\n\"Isn't that the lawyer?\" Three rows back, not a question. Sofia's smile stays put but my jaw locks like a vault. The slip reads like a subpoena: dates, invoice numbers, the kind of paperwork that births rumors—and if this gets back to my firm, I'll lose the partnership I've spent seven years building.\n\nI fold my face into deposition mode—neutral, unhelpful—and slide the program shut. The vendor note goes behind the hymn list where it can't cause damage. I don't throw it away. Evidence has a chain of custody and so do reputations.\n\nThe woman beside me shifts in her seat, eyeing the paper. She leans closer, perfume heavy with jasmine.\n\n\"Beautiful ceremony.\"\n\nHer mouth pinches. \"Shame about the... distraction.\"\n\nI tilt my chin. Permission and warning in one movement.\n\nMarco stands at the end of the row, shoulders like a wall. When he catches my eye he doesn't smile—just nods once. Apology and alliance rolled into one gesture. He smells like sunblock and rosemary from whatever the kitchen staff rubbed on the bread.\n\nHis voice stays low, meant only for me. \"Everything looks perfect.\"\n\n\"I'd like to—\" The word slips out before I can stop it. \"Loaded question.\"\n\nHe steps closer, blocking the sun. \"Which witness would that be?\"\n\nThe priest raises his hands toward the couple. \"You may kiss the bride.\"\n\nThe applause comes thin and puzzled, like someone testing crystal for hairline cracks. I stay put with the program folded hard between my fingers. Moving means surrender. Sitting still means defense.\n\nA champagne flute shatters somewhere behind me, crystal exploding against stone.\n\nShoes scuff. Someone mutters behind me, voice sharp with gossip-hunger.\n\n\"How messy.\"\n\n\"Messier than most,\" another voice agrees.\n\nMarco leans close. Salt grit at the corner of his mouth, breath warm against my ear. \"Stay with her, okay?\"\n\nI press my clutch against my ribs instead of answering. The program crinkles inside. My thumb covers the words *legal records* so they're under skin instead of headline.\n\nThe priest finishes. Sofia and Dante turn toward us and the crowd reads like an open book with half the pages torn out—curiosity, judgment, pity in equal measure. Champagne carts roll forward like apologetic ships.\n\nSofia catches my eye across the sea of faces. Her smile wavers for just a second—a crack in the porcelain.\n\n\"Lena?\" Her voice carries over the crowd. \"Everything all right?\"\n\n\"The view is—\" I force my mouth into courtroom neutral. \"Just admiring the view.\"\n\nThe program slips from my clutch anyway. Lands face up where the courier font stays stubbornly legible, permanent as a tattoo. I watch Dante squeeze Sofia's fingers—hard, small, we're still here—and step back into the procession.\n\nThe reception waits. The microphone waits. My confession waits.\n\nI push through the crowd toward the villa, leaving the program where it fell.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Reception terrace beneath strings of lights and bougainvillea. A damp paper napkin clings to the sole of my sandal. I peel it free with my toes, stuff it into my clutch, and walk to the mic. The terrace stones sear through the thin leather of my shoes. Feedback whispers through the wire and the terrace leans in—plates click, a fork skitters, someone's laugh cuts off when Sofia's eyes sweep the crowd. The string lights overhead sway, casting shifting shadows across upturned faces.\n\n\"Perdóname, Sofia.\" My Spanish sounds ridiculous under the lights. The mic catches my breath and broadcasts it.\n\nThe chatter dies. Waves crash against the cliffs below, filling the quiet between heartbeats. I press my thumb into the cold metal like it's evidence I can weigh. \"The case file with my initials—it involved Dante's family.\" My lawyer voice kicks in—steady, factual. Faces rearrange themselves around the words. A server freezes mid-pour, wine bottle hovering over crystal.\n\nI keep talking because stopping would let the silence rot into something worse.\n\nI pressed my temple with my free hand.\n\nSofia's hand touches the back of my neck for half a second—small and fierce. My fingers still smell like her champagne. The warmth of her palm lingers even after she pulls away, and I can feel the weight of every guest's attention pressing against my ribs like a physical force that makes breathing difficult.\n\n\"Lena—\" Sofia starts.\n\n\"Signora Gianna.\" I turn toward the head table, my heel catching slightly on the uneven stone. \"Mi dispiace.\" The Italian feels clumsy in my mouth. \"I didn't betray your trust as a person. I represented a case as a lawyer.\"\n\nMy consonants crash into each other. Gianna's mouth tightens. Her posture forgets steel for a beat. Her wedding ring catches light as she adjusts her napkin. The lace tablecloth shifts under my fingers, and I catch the faint scent of jasmine from the centerpieces mixing with the salt air.\n\nI rotated my ring slowly.\n\nI didn't tell Sofia because I didn't want paperwork to ruin her day. I treated history like a file that could be sealed. The microphone cord brushes my wrist as I shift, and somewhere behind me a chair creaks as someone leans forward.\n\nA wine glass shatters somewhere behind me—crystal exploding against stone in a cascade of sharp notes.\n\n\"I kept quiet because—\" I swallow hard. \"Because I thought someone would use it against you both.\"\n\nMy voice drops but doesn't break. The terrace holds its breath. Even the cicadas pause. The string lights cast amber pools across the stone, and I can see dust motes dancing in the warm air.\n\nNapkins rustle. Dante's shoulder shifts. He leans forward slightly, his forearms resting on the white tablecloth. His wedding band catches the light, and there's something in his expression that reminds me of Marco—that careful way of listening that comes from years of weighing words before they're spoken.\n\n\"So what now?\" His voice is gentler than the question deserves. \"What are you asking for, Lena?\"\n\nHis question cuts clean through the formal air. His wedding band glints as he reaches for Sofia's hand. The gesture is automatic, protective, and I understand why Sofia chose him. There's steadiness in the way he moves, like he's already decided what matters.\n\nI tugged at my collar.\n\nI look at Marco because this isn't about procedure. It's about asking permission to do something that terrifies me. His face is unreadable in the golden light, but tension pulls at his jaw. His free hand rests flat against the table. The wine in his glass shivers slightly, catching reflections of the overhead lights.\n\n\"Marco.\" I pull his name like something fragile from the dark. My throat feels raw. \"Can I—\" The words tangle. I try again. \"Will you let me try? With you?\"\n\n\"Lena, what are you—\"\n\n\"I don't—\" I stop. Start again. \"This isn't about the case anymore.\"\n\nGianna exhales through her nose. Someone's plate clinks. Sofia's cheeks shine with sweat and what looks like relief. A breeze lifts off the water, carrying the scent of wild rosemary from the cliffs.\n\nI bit my cheek.\n\nMarco stands. His chair scrapes stone with a sound that slices the evening air. His hand curls around his wineglass, knuckles white. He sets it down slow, deliberate. The wine shivers. He crosses to me with the careful steps of a man who's carried too much weight for too long, each footstep echoing against the stone while I hear the rustle of his shirt, the soft whisper of fabric against skin as he moves through the amber light.\n\nHe stops right there, and I can smell his cologne mixed with sea salt. \"You want to ask me something, bella?\"\n\nHis voice stays low but carries across the terrace. He reaches for my free hand.\n\n\"Then ask me properly.\"\n\nHe takes my fingers. The calluses on his palms catch against my skin—rough as barnacles on a ship's hull. He doesn't promise anything clean or easy. He presses his hand and holds it there. His thumb traces across my knuckles, and I feel the slight tremor in his grip—not fear, but something deeper. Recognition, maybe. The understanding that some questions can only be answered with time.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Private wine cellar under the monastery, late evening. The cellar door thuds shut behind us. My palms slip against the wood. Cool air wraps around my sundress; old oak and citron rind press into my nose, and someone has stuck an Esselunga receipt to a barrel with the corner flapping like a tiny desperate flag. Marco stands with his shoulder braced against a rack of bottles, dust motes drifting between the glass, and he looks too steady for the way my breath wants to trip.\n\nI pressed my temple against the cool stone wall.\n\nHe reaches into his jacket pocket and draws out the wedding program, edges soft from folding, my handwriting scrawled in the margin—tiny loops, an abbreviation for objection, a cross-out where I tried to be funny and failed. The paper smells like candle wax and the faint sweetness of limoncello that dried sticky on the step outside. His thumb hovers over my scrawl like he's afraid he'll smudge it. He holds it out.\n\n\"This yours?\" His voice catches on something rough.\n\nI twist a loose strand from my face. The curl won't stay. \"Kept it like evidence.\"\n\nHe shifts, his shoulder measuring the restraint he's been practicing. The bottles behind him catch the dim light filtering through the single window, amber and green glass throwing patterns on the stone walls.\n\n\"Evidence of what?\" He flips the program open, thumbs the corner where my tiny notes drifted into a doodle. \"You planning to cross-examine me, counselor?\"\n\nMy words come quick, clipped. \"Might have to.\" I press my lips together. The taste of wedding cake frosting still clings to my tongue, too sweet now. \"I didn't tell you because—\"\n\nThe paper whispers against his fingers as he closes the program.\n\n\"Because?\"\n\n\"Because silence felt safer than watching everything blow up.\" I shove my hands into my dress pockets. The fabric bunches awkwardly, and I can feel the outline of my phone, the sharp edge of a mint I forgot about. \"When I was sixteen, I kept my father's affair secret for months. Thought I was protecting my mother.\"\n\nHe goes still.\n\n\"Learned that silence can masquerade as kindness.\" Spanish edges into my throat. \"Dios mío, it turns into poison.\"\n\n\"So you decided for both of us.\" He folds the program closed, then opens it again. The paper rustles between his fingers like dried leaves. His jaw works, and I can see the muscle ticking beneath the skin.\n\n\"I decided—\" My voice cracks. The sound echoes off the stone walls, bouncing back at us from the shadows between the wine racks. \"I'm terrified of wanting something I might destroy just by wanting it.\"\n\nHe steps closer. His shoulder presses against mine; the rack of bottles stands witness, wine labels a line of silent jurors. The coolness of the cellar seems to concentrate around us, making the warmth of his body more noticeable. His hand finds mine—not dramatic, just fingers aligning with mine the way two pieces that have been trimmed and stacked eventually fit.\n\n\"Lena.\" He waits until I meet his eyes. No charm, no deflection. The gold flecks in the brown remind me of sunlight through amber bottles, and I realize I've been cataloguing the details of his face without meaning to—the slight scar above his left eyebrow, the way his mouth curves even when he's not smiling. \"I'm not going anywhere.\"\n\n\"You don't know that.\" The words flinch out of me. My free hand finds the rough stone wall behind me, needing something solid to press against. \"People always think they won't leave until—\"\n\n\"Until what?\" He cuts me off, his voice sharper now.\n\nI don't— The words stick in my throat. \"Until they do.\"\n\nHe watches my mouth while I say it, then closes the distance between us with the slow economy of someone who has practiced restraint for years and decides restraint is the lie. His hand slides up from mine to the curve of my wrist and he presses, not hard, just enough to anchor. I can feel my pulse jumping against his thumb like a trapped bird.\n\n\"Then we'll figure it out.\" His voice drops lower. \"As we go.\"\n\nHe leans in, within arm's reach, and I can count the flecks of gold in his brown eyes, close enough that his breath mingles with mine and carries the faint taste of the prosecco from upstairs. The wedding program crinkles between us, and his free hand comes up to trace the line of my jaw, thumb brushing across my cheek with the kind of reverence that makes my knees forget how to hold me upright.\n\n\"Marco.\" His name breaks on my lips like a confession, like a prayer I didn't know I'd been holding.\n\nHis forehead touches mine, and I can feel the question he's asking without words, the way his thumb stills against my pulse point, waiting. The silence between us hums with everything we haven't said, everything we've been dancing around for months. My heart hammers so hard I'm sure he can feel it through my skin.\n\n\"Tell me what you want,\" he whispers, and the words ghost across my lips. \"No more silence. No more deciding for both of us.\" Because whatever I say next will either open the door to everything I've been afraid to hope for or close it forever.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Reception terrace under citron trees, twilight. \"Take care of her.\" The words slice through wedding laughter and clinking glasses, and I'm standing here holding a folded napkin like it contains state secrets instead of wedding cake crumbs and Marco's grandmother's grudging approval.\n\nThe sugar cracks loud against my teeth—candied grapefruit pith bitter and honest on my tongue while Gianna watches me like I'm evidence being admitted to court.\n\nDante's elbow clips my ribs as he spins through the last chorus, and his apology tumbles out breathless.\n\n\"Sorry, Lena—shit.\" His voice wobbles the way good men wobble when they've tried too hard to be perfect and spilled sauce on the tablecloth.\n\nI pivot, the hem of my dress brushing a sticky smear of gelato on the flagstone. Someone abandoned a child's cone to perish in the heat and the terrace smells faintly of sugar and old orange zest oil now, which is oddly domestic and entirely unromantic. I let the joke land where it will.\n\n\"Motion denied.\" I flash him a sharp smile. \"Lack of basic coordination.\"\n\nGianna crosses the lantern-lit stones with precision that makes the servers straighten and the string lights seem less casual, her heels striking a steady rhythm. I feel her approach before I see her—a cool shift in the air, someone carrying authority like a shawl. She stops a foot away, folds a linen napkin into an exact square with two fingers, and tucks a single candied bergamot slice into the center like it's a small offering. Her hands do not tremble. She holds the parcel out to me without ceremony.\n\nI keep my hands where they are because reflex is professional. My fingers remember courtroom formality the way my legs remember running up Riverside Park at six a.m. Marco shifts beside me, close enough that his knuckles brush my wrist. He doesn't thrum with possessiveness; instead his presence is a quiet calibration.\n\n\"Sofia.\" Gianna's voice carries the weight of formal pronouncement. \"What you did for her today.\"\n\n\"She saved the whole thing,\" Marco says. His tone stays casual but there's steel underneath. \"The paperwork, the speech—\"\n\nHe glances at Gianna, waiting for something I can't read.\n\nGianna's mouth softens just enough. Her eyes find mine and hold.\n\n\"You stayed. When others would have left.\"\n\nShe doesn't elaborate. The candied honeysuckle between my palms warms from my skin. My laugh comes out dry as courtroom air.\n\n\"That's not exactly a glowing character reference.\" I tilt my head. \"Defense notes that basic decency isn't admissible evidence.\"\n\nShe lets that stand for a beat, studying my face like she's reading fine print.\n\n\"I protect this family.\" Then, softer, her fingers tapping the napkin: \"I see when someone else does the same. For the right reasons.\"\n\nShe reaches out and touches the square napkin with the pad of her finger as if marking the place where trust could be folded.\n\n\"Rispetto. Proper respect.\"\n\nSofia squeezes past us, cheeks flushed with the practiced exhaustion of a bride who has won.\n\n\"Oh honey, did you get cake on your shoe?\" Her words tumble in that way that wraps everything in warmth. She grabs my free hand, bouncing slightly. \"And Lena, did you see the fireworks? They set off the little ones by the cove—unplanned but so romantic, right?\"\n\nGianna meets Sofia's gaze with something that might be relief, then turns that look back to me. Her voice drops to something almost private.\n\n\"Take care of her.\"\n\nThe words hang in the air, meant for no one and everyone. Then she steps away, the skirts of her dress moving like a measured exhale.\n\nI hold the napkin like it's evidence and then, because I'm inexplicably curious and stubborn in equal parts, I peel back the corner to expose the candied jasmine. The sugar is tacky; the flavor is sharply sweet and the pith is bright and honest and not meant to be elegant. Marco watches my hands as if they are pages in a book he's only allowed to read.\n\n\"Eat it.\" His voice goes soft, the Italian lilt smoothing his words. \"Trust me. It's tradition.\"\n\nI slide the slice into my mouth. The sugar cracks loud against the quiet, the lime's bitterness sparking against my tongue. I don't make any promises. I only say, \"Gracias,\" in Spanish, the word small and precise, and then I cross the terrace toward the dance floor because Sofia is calling and the music has started again and there are guests who need coaxing back into laughter. The napkin, still folded, sits in my palm.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Guest suite overlooking the grapefruit groves, late night packing. The zipper snags under my thumb. I jerk it back the way you pry open a sealed deposition, breath held because if a suitcase refuses to cooperate everything else will too. Marco leans over, palms flat on the citrine linen, smoothing the fold like he's aligning a signature. His fingers press at a frayed hem.\n\n\"Hey.\" He catches my wrist gently. \"We can figure this out together.\"\n\nI pull back, automatic. \"I object. This whole situation has way too many moving parts.\"\n\nThe nightstand wears a sticky ring where someone left a glass. The luggage rack squeaks when I set the suitcase down, wood protesting against metal hinges.\n\nI pressed my temple and gripped the edge of the table.\n\nI fold the napkin the way I used to file exhibits: crisp corners, neat stacks, everything with a label in my head—sheets, towels, spare dress. Each fold lands with a small sound, linen brushing linen like footsteps in a stairwell. Marco watches the motions, his jaw shifting when he's deciding whether to joke or tell the truth.\n\nHe runs a palm flat on the table. \"Promise me something.\"\n\nI smooth another fold. \"Depends what it is.\"\n\n\"Promise you'll tell me when it gets to be too much.\" His voice drops, goes quiet. \"When I get to be too much.\"\n\nI thumb a loose thread, an automatic attempt to fix a wordless thing. The words stick in my throat for a moment. \"Understood.\"\n\nHe laughs, surprised. \"That's not how you use that word.\"\n\nI shrug. \"It's how I use it.\"\n\nHe puts his hand in the suitcase, flattens the citrine pillowcase against my stack. For a second our palms meet over cotton and the fabric smells like soap and the ghost of an entire day's cooking.\n\n\"We need ground rules.\" I tick off on my fingers. \"No shop talk at dinner unless someone's literally bleeding. Three calls a week that aren't about work. Complete transparency about family stuff—no mysterious disappearances.\"\n\nHe nods, considering. \"What about when my mother calls at two AM because she had another dream about Luca?\"\n\nThe sentence hangs there because there's a ledger in my head adding air miles and billable hours and grief in equal columns. \n\nA door slams somewhere in the house—Dante or Gianna heading to bed, the sound echoing through the walls like a judge's gavel.\n\nHe nods twice, slow, like a judge giving a bench ruling, then cracks a grin that doesn't quite reach his eyes.\n\n\"Then you answer.\" I fold another pillowcase. \"And you tell me why you're awake.\"\n\nHe tells me about Luca—again, but with a different detail: how when Papa died he did math for a household of two kids with a broken roof, how he signed forms, scheduled doctors, folded permission slips into his back pocket.\n\n\"After Papa died, I wasn't really his brother anymore.\" He stares at his hands. \"I was the guy who made sure he ate breakfast and did his homework and—\"\n\nI stop folding. \"You were fifteen.\"\n\n\"Doesn't matter.\" His shoulders tense. \"I was what he had. And I wasn't enough.\"\n\nI twist a tendril of hair back. \"Then we work around that.\" He watches me calculate, the lawyer and the man trading spreadsheets made of gut and calendar dates.\n\nWe trade specifics: one weekend a month in Amalfi, one two-week stretch in the summer, weekly calls on Thursdays unless it's a funeral or a slow-burn emergency on his side. If either of us needs space we say so aloud—no passive-aggressive disappearances, no ghosting by omission.\n\nHe reaches for my hand. \"And you have to tell me when you're scared.\"\n\nI pull away slightly. \"I don't get scared. I get prepared.\"\n\n\"Lena.\"\n\nI look at him finally. \"Fine. But no cross-examining me about my feelings.\"\n\n\"Deal.\" He grins, and this time it reaches his eyes. \"Though technically that would be direct examination.\"\n\nI shove his shoulder. \"Shut up.\"\n\nI slide a small itinerary into the inside pocket—flight numbers, dates written in my cramped handwriting. The zipper catches for a breath, then releases. The suitcase closes with a clean, final sound.",

      "content": "He presses the small iron key into my palm before I can ask what it opens, fingers warm against the knuckles where the skin puckers when I clench. The iron is pitted and heavy, older than it looks; a citron leaf is scratched into the bow, tiny veins like a cartographer's lines. A half-melted votive dripped down the terrace ledge and hardened into a lumpy stain with a single grapefruit seed stuck in the wax—that ugly, ordinary thing anchors the moonlit prettiness. Enzo leans on the fountain rail below with a grin that refuses to be solemn, and because I see him I know Marco's hand just left mine.\n\n\"What is this?\" The key bites into my palm when I squeeze it.\n\nMarco steps back, giving me space to breathe. He runs his fingers along his collar. \"Take it.\" His voice drops low enough that the cicadas nearly swallow it. \"Prendila, bella.\"\n\nHe waits, hands loose at his sides now, and the neither of us fills the gap between us until the waiting feels like its own kind of argument. His jacket carries espresso and talc; when his thumb brushed his palm it left the faint grit of salt, the ordinary residue of being awake and moving. Enzo below lifts one shoulder in a private laugh that reads like permission.\n\nI roll the key between my fingers, feeling the ridges catch against my skin. \"Objection—relevance.\"\n\nI turn the key over and count the ridges like a prosecutor counting exhibits, slower and slower until the slow becomes attention. The engraving is off-center; the stem is nicked as if it has seen a real lock, not a jewelry box, and the whole thing has a thumb-worn gleam where someone habitually held it.\n\nMarco folds his hands on the balustrade, looking out toward the black seam of the sea. \"Enzo loved keys. Stupid little found things.\" His laugh comes out soft, unguarded. He glances at me sideways. \"Said they were promises you could walk away from.\"\n\nA pause. He shifts his weight against the stone.\n\n\"This was in my pocket all day.\"\n\nI catch the loose hair from my temple—habit, diagnostic—buying myself another second to think. \"Literal lock or emotional metaphor?\"\n\nMarco's smile tightens in that particular way it does when he's deciding whether to be tender or blunt. He chooses both. \"Sì.\"\n\nThe word sits between us, not quite a promise but not empty either. He searches for something else, then lets it go. His shoulders lift slightly. \"Lock whatever you want. A drawer. Some stupid box.\" He touches the stone railing with two fingers. \"Or don't lock anything. Just—\"\n\n\"Keep it close!\" Enzo's voice carries up like a stone skipping water, mischief tucked at the edges but something like benediction underneath.\n\nMarco turns his head just enough for me to see the light catch his profile, the way the moon picks out a freckle near his temple. \"I want you to have something that belonged to me.\" He pauses. \"Not words. Not plans.\"\n\nI close my fist around the key. The metal is warm—not the heat of exertion but the comfortable, human heat of something kept close to skin; the orange zest leaf catches the moon and looks almost like a real leaf, fragile and ridiculous. My training runs a checklist—risk, relevance, cost—and then the checklist folds up like a paper I decided not to file. I slide the key into the interior pocket of my linen jacket because dresses without pockets are an aesthetic crime but also because pockets are practical.\n\nMarco watches me tuck it away. His voice goes quieter. \"Promise me you'll tell me when you're scared.\"\n\nNot a courtroom demand—quieter than that, like he's offering an unpaid favor. I hear the fatigue behind it, the part of his chest that learned to hold other people's needs before his own.\n\nI shrug one shoulder. \"I'll tell you when I litigate you into silence.\"\n\nIt lands as a joke that isn't entirely a joke. He smiles—real, not teasing this time—and Enzo claps once, soft, like applause from a bench. The party downstairs thins; a glass breaks somewhere in the garden and Dante's laugh threads through the stone. We drift down from the terrace toward the sound. I finger the key in my pocket, feel the warm press of iron against fabric, and then Marco takes a step closer.\n\nHis hands find the railing on either side of me, not trapping but present. The space between us shrinks to nothing but breath and moonlight. \"What if I kissed you right now?\" His voice comes out rougher than he intended. \"What if I stopped pretending I don't want to?\"\n\nMy mouth opens but no clever response comes. The key burns against my ribs through the fabric, and I realize I've been holding my breath. Marco's looking at me like he's memorizing the exact moment I forgot how to argue, and I can feel myself leaning forward before I remember I'm supposed to be the one in control.\n\n\"Marco,\" I whisper, and it comes out like surrender.",

      "content": "Lena Castillo found herself in the Monastery upper terrace, morning after the wedding; orange zest trees heavy with late fruit, a scattering of citrus confetti in the stone gutters. The embroidered bergamot catches light like a small accusation.\n\nI freeze mid-step on the monastery path, pulse hammering against my throat because the napkin shouldn't be here—folded neat and deliberate on the bench where morning sun strikes it, where I'd have to see it walking back from the fountain. Evidence doesn't just appear. Someone placed it in the exact center, waiting.\n\nMy hands still hunt for evidence. It's habit. My fingers find the hand-stitched corner, thicker than reception linen, done with tiny, exacting stitches that speak of patience and precision in a way that makes my chest tighten with something I don't want to name. When I smooth it open, the seam reveals a place where one stitch was doubled over—an almost-invisible correction. Whoever made this refuses to let imperfection stand. The stitchwork demands study the way a witness's micro-expressions do in cross-examination. The maker trusted their thread to a straight line, then quietly fixed it without making a scene.\n\n\"Signorina Castillo.\" Gianna's voice is a chord struck close and held. She stands in the shadow of a honeysuckle tree, palms folded over the back of a chair as if arranging posture could steady whatever my eyes won't supply.\n\nI hold the napkin up between us like exhibit A. \"Drop-offs at dawn now?\"\n\nGianna steps closer. Morning air lifts the loose hair at her temples, and her perfume is citrus but sharper—bergamot and something bitter that feels like the first part of a reprimand. She glances at the embroidery, then back to my face. \"The birds woke me.\"\n\n\"Right.\" I fold the napkin again, careful to show nothing—showing nothing has gotten me this far. \"Birds made you embroider jasmine at five AM.\"\n\nHer hands do not flutter. She touches the lime tree's bark instead. \"Per rispetto.\"\n\nI press the corner of the linen between my thumb and palm, feeling the slightly raised knot where the embroiderer's thread began. That tiny knot is more intimate than any of the speeches from last night. \"You could have just knocked.\"\n\nGianna's fingers close around a low-hanging citron without picking it. \"Knocking is for—\" She pauses, searching for words that won't cut too deep. \"For business.\"\n\nShe places a small thing wrapped in wax paper on the bench—leftover grapefruit confetti, perhaps, or a single sugared amaretti. \"For Sofia. She likes sweet things in the morning.\"\n\nMy mouth opens, then closes. The automatic objection dies somewhere between my brain and my tongue.\n\n\"This doesn't change anything.\" Gianna's voice carries the weight of someone who's made peace with a difficult truth.\n\nI tuck the napkin into my sundress pocket. \"No. It doesn't.\"\n\nSofia arrives behind Gianna, hair wild and gown rumpled into a softer kind of triumph. She stops short, eyes darting between us. \"Are you two... talking? Like, actual words instead of Italian death rays?\"\n\nDante follows, hands in his pockets, smelling faintly of coffee and olive oil. He surveys the orange zest tree, the bench, the careful distance between his aunt and me. \"Should I be worried?\"\n\n\"We're establishing ground rules,\" I say.\n\nGianna straightens her already-perfect posture. \"Boundaries.\"\n\nSofia bounces on her toes. \"Boundaries I can live with?\"\n\n\"The kind that don't require witness protection,\" Dante adds, grinning at his own joke.\n\nGianna looks at me directly for the first time, and something shifts in her expression—not warmth exactly, but the absence of winter. \"Per rispetto.\"\n\nI nod once, sharp and final. \"Understood.\"\n\nHours later, when the sun had set and the monastery settled into evening quiet, the cicadas climb in volume. I walk back across the sugar-gritty grout with the napkin heavy in my pocket, my fingers finding the iron key in the other pocket, feeling its cool edge.",

I push the narrow ante-room door open. The table waits like evidence, and he's there with sleeves rolled to the elbow, forearms dusted with flour where he's been kneading something. The air tastes of rosemary and old wood. On the table, the stamped court cover sits square and official, and a photograph—folded small enough to hide in a palm—peeks from the crease. A blue supermarket price sticker, 1,95€, curls from the table leg.\n\nThe smell of yeast rises from whatever he's been working—bread, maybe, or focaccia. His hands still carry the ghost of flour, white dust settled into the creases of his knuckles. He's positioned himself angled so he can see both the door and the papers, like he's been waiting but won't admit it.\n\n\"The original.\" His fingers hover over the court cover like it might bite back.\n\nI straighten an already-straight napkin. \"Figured you wouldn't want to see it.\"\n\nThe seconds stack up without words between us, filled with the distant sound of someone sweeping in the courtyard below. My throat feels dry, the way it does before difficult testimony. I watch his shoulders rise and fall with controlled breathing.\n\nI pressed my temple and turned the glass slowly.\n\nHe lifts the photograph from the table with careful fingers and the room shrinks around the small square: a boy about twelve, missing teeth, mud on one knee—Luca. Marco's mouth goes tight. The same way his father's did when choosing silence over screaming.\n\nThe photograph trembles slightly in his grip. I can see the worn edges where someone—Sofia, probably—has handled it countless times. The boy's smile is gap-toothed and genuine, caught mid-laugh at something beyond the camera's frame.\n\nA door slams somewhere in the house, followed by quick footsteps on the stairs.\n\n\"Couldn't leave it to whispers.\" He sets the photo down, pushes it toward the center of the table. \"People fill gaps with—\"\n\n\"Stories.\" His thumb traces the stamp on the cover. I taste copper, like biting my tongue during depositions. My brain reaches for legalese—public records, chain of custody, procedural clarification—but I swallow it.\n\nThe candle flame wavers, casting shifting shadows across the legal documents. I catalog details the way I do in depositions: the precise fold of the photograph, the way Marco's signet ring catches the light when he moves his hand, the faint stain on the table's edge that looks like wine.\n\n\"Should've told you sooner.\"\n\nHe exhales through his nose. \"Don't need your legal armor right now, Lena.\" His voice catches on my name. \"Just need to know what happens next. For Sofia.\"\n\nHis fingers drum against the photograph. I outline what comes next. Registry copy, short statement of representation and dates, no extra narrative, delivery through Enzo to Sofia's hand, posted to the family registry with receipt.\n\nI tugged my collar and grabbed the edge of the table.\n\nHe listens without interrupting, which surprises me. Usually he cuts through my explanations with questions or challenges, but tonight he just nods at the right moments, his eyes never leaving the photograph.\n\n\"Check-ins.\" He runs his hand down his face. \"Twenty minutes. You tell me when you're traveling—\"\n\n\"I tell you when I need space.\"\n\nI roll the proposal around in my mouth. \"Two visits a month. One weekend here, one in New York.\" I cross my arms, uncross them. \"Forty-eight hours notice if plans change.\"\n\nThe words sound clinical even to me, like we're negotiating a custody agreement instead of whatever this is. But maybe that's what we need—clear boundaries, defined expectations. The lawyer in me approves even as something deeper rebels against reducing this to terms and conditions.\n\n\"No instant responses.\" He gestures at the gap that separated us. \"We respect time zones and court schedules and—\"\n\n\"Whatever else gets in the way.\"\n\nHe slides the photograph back toward me. \"Used to steal bergamot from Nonna's tree. Hide them in his pockets.\" A ghost of a smile. \"Dante says that's how he learned to cook—watching Luca raid the kitchen.\"\n\nI let the corners of the photo brush my thumbnail. The scar on my left palm pricks—old glass, old guilt. \"Lo siento.\" The Spanish slips out before I can catch it. \"I should have—I let the rumors...\"\n\nThe boy in the photograph stares up at us with eyes that look like Marco's, that same intensity even at twelve. I wonder if he had Marco's stubborn streak too, if he argued about bedtime and homework the way Sofia probably does.\n\nHe closes his fingers over mine on the photo. Just for a second. \"No vows.\" His eyes find mine. \"Small promises. Truth, even when it's ugly.\"\n\n\"That's not—\" I stop. \"Bene.\" The word comes out mangled, my accent butchering the vowels.\n\nWe lean in until the dying candle threads light across our faces. Our mouths meet—brief, precise, like sealing an envelope. When we break apart, I reach for my jacket and head toward the door.",

      "content": "\"Caffè?\" Marco called from the kitchen, his voice rough around the edges like he'd been awake longer than he'd admit. I pushed through the doorway and found him juggling a tray—white cups rattling against saucers, a plate of those paper-thin cookies balanced in his other hand like he was defying physics. The morning light felt different somehow, softer than the harsh fluorescents of last night's crisis, but my shoulders still carried the weight of everything unsaid between us. Abuela's empanada dough sat under a tea towel, the mason jar smudged with floury fingerprints. Someone had been checking on it.\n\nThe linens on the drying rack were still warm from the sun, smelling like that detergent with too much lavender that made me sneeze if I buried my face in the towels.\n\nHe grinned, one eyebrow cocked, steadying the tray with fingers that bore a white scar under the thumb—old pruning accident, he'd told me once. I moved toward the counter because the smell of fried dough was making my stomach growl, and my phone started vibrating against the stone like an angry wasp.\n\nOFFER in all caps. Manhattan firm. The one I'd been waiting on for three months. If I didn't respond by noon tomorrow, they'd move to their backup candidate. Partner track. The kind of position that doesn't knock twice.\n\nI flipped the screen and read while pouring coffee, skimmed to the salary line because old habits die hard. The number made me grip the cup until the porcelain creaked.\n\nMarco watched my face change. He set the tray down slowly.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Job offer.\" I set the cup down harder than necessary. \"Manhattan firm.\"\n\nThe words hung there while I tried to calculate time zones and billable hours and how long a person could realistically live in two countries before something snapped.\n\nHe placed a biscotto next to my cup, his fingers lingering on the plate.\n\n\"So you take it.\" He shrugged, but his jaw tightened. \"Fly when you need to. Come back when you can.\"\n\nNo drama. Just logistics. We traded details like we were negotiating a contract, which maybe we were.\n\nI squinted at the fine print.\n\n\"Remote twenty percent, travel two months per quarter.\" I stared up. \"Emergency response within seventy-two hours.\"\n\nHe laughed, but it came out hollow. His hand found the back of his neck.\n\n\"Seventy-two hours? Madonna, they really think they own you.\"\n\nI pressed my palm against the mason jar, letting the cool glass steady me.\n\n\"What if I get there and remember why I ran away in the first place?\"\n\nSomething shifted in his expression. He leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms.\n\n\"Then you decide again.\"\n\nThe deadline wasn't theoretical anymore. My chest constricted.\n\n\"Wait—\"\n\nHe raised his hands in mock surrender.\n\n\"Overruled by reality.\" His smile faded. \"But first—\"\n\nHe pulled out a small iron key, the old-fashioned kind that belonged on a ring with maybe three others. Heavy, worn smooth at the edges. He had one clipped to his keychain; this was the spare to Enzo's place, the one that opened the little lock by the pantry.\n\nHe held it out between us.\n\nThe metal was cool, then warm under my fingers.\n\n\"Don't make this symbolic.\"\n\n\"Too late.\" His mouth quirked up at one corner.\n\nI closed my fist around the key.\n\n\"Ground rules. Check-ins when we travel. No disappearing acts.\"\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nWe mapped it out across the table—blocked months, dawn conference calls, return trips timed around olive harvest and the neighbor kid's soccer schedule since his ball kept landing on our terrace. He corrected my pronunciation of rosmarino, patient as a language teacher.\n\n\"Ros-ma-REE-no.\"\n\nI tried it three times before getting close, called it rozmarino once and made him laugh.\n\nWhen we finished, the calendar looked less like a compromise and more like something that might actually work.\n\nI tested the water one more time.\n\n\"If things go sideways, we tell the truth first. No protecting each other's feelings.\"\n\nHe looked at me then, the teasing dropping away. Something solid settled in his expression.\n\n\"Promise me, Lena.\"\n\nThe key bit into my palm where I'd been gripping it too tight. Marco's eyes held mine, waiting for an answer that felt like it would change everything. I opened my mouth to give him the easy promise, the safe one that would keep us both protected.\n\nInstead, what came out was, \"I think I'm already in too deep to make promises like that.\"\n\nHis breath caught. The space between us felt electric, charged with everything we hadn't said.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nMy phone buzzed again on the counter—probably the firm following up, probably urgent. I didn't look. I couldn't look away from Marco's face, from the way he was watching me like I held something fragile and precious in my hands.\n\n\"I mean I've spent my whole life running from anything that felt like this.\" The words scraped against my throat. \"And now I'm standing here holding your key, making plans like we're—\" I stopped, my heart hammering against my ribs. \"Like we're something real.\"",
