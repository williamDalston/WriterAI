## 🚀 To Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Create New GitHub Repository (Recommended)

**Step 1**: Create a new repository on GitHub
- Go to https://github.com/new
- Name: `WriterAI` or `prometheus-novel`
- Description: "AI-powered novel generation system with beautiful UX"
- **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one!)
- Click "Create repository"

**Step 2**: Connect your local repository
```bash
cd /Users/williamalston/Desktop/WriterAI

# Add the remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/WriterAI.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Push to Existing Repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
cd /Users/williamalston/Desktop/WriterAI

# Add the remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
